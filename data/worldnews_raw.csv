364082498,‘Pull our weight’: Albo’s call on Trump meet,"The Prime Minister will return to the US in later October for a face-to-face with Mr Trump at the White House.

The highly anticipated meet will take place nearly a year after Mr Trump’s historic presidential come back, with Mr Albanese under fire for not having secured a meeting earlier.

Amid criticism from the Coalition he has jeopardised the Australia-US relationship by not visiting sooner, Mr Albanese was asked on Sunday (AEST) if he had any “trepidation” about the meeting.

“No, not at all,” he told Sky News. 

“The discussions we’ve had have been very positive and constructive, and Australia and United States are great friends.

“We pull our weight and … it’s not a relationship of unequals.”

He went on to say the US “is obviously the largest economy in the world, the most powerful country in the world, but Australia always we punch way above our weight”.

He also said he has “had a number of discussions with people in the administration”, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Mr Bessent is key to rolling out Mr Trump’s “America First” vision.

The two leaders briefly met earlier this week at a reception Mr Trump hosted in New York.

Mr Albanese even snapped a selfie with him.

364082500,Multimillion dollar yacht engulfed in flames,"Firefighters were called to Hillarys Boat Harbour just before 11am to find thick, black smoke billowing out of the 50-foot boat moored at the marina.

Locals had done their best to contain the fire, with several boaties using the marina’s hoses to dry and douse the inferno from neighbouring boats.

After almost an hour battling the blaze, emergency services were able to control the fire and prevent it spreading to other boats in the harbour.

It’s understood the owner was not on board at the time but has been notified.

Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) district officer Steve Lusk said about 30 firefighters had been involved in the battle. 

Mr Lusk also explained the main concern for emergency services was an estimated 1500 litres of diesel that remained in the boat, suggesting fires like this were “very hazardous just by the sheer nature of the combustible material”.

The Department issued a warning to nearby residents over the black smoke that continued to billow from the boat.

“As a precautionary measure, people in the area should remain inside, out of the smoke or fumes, with doors and windows closed. Airconditioners should also be switched off,” WA DFES said.","The boat, valued at more than $2 million, was gutted by an inferno that tore through the vessel on Saturday morning.",https://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/multimillion-dollar-yacht-engulfed-by-inferno-in-perth-marina-sunk/news-story/5ffdb59c20c0f5f029a83e602cc31b67?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/8a1c83009fef9c73378e0448ad6347c2,,2025-09-28 00:10:48,Thomas Henry,['Thomas Henry'],en,,au,-0.776
364082494,"The DNA, the schooner and the daring police sting: the amazing story of how the ‘Moore Park Rapist’ was caught","The Alice Springs man and funeral director was on his way to Thailand with his partner the following day.

Little did he know that NSW Police were secretly watching and that he was about to be unmasked as one of Sydney’s most notorious serial rapists after escaping justice for over 30 years.

In the end, a fork and schooner, a daring covert police operation and a DNA test which found a needle in a haystack led to a remarkable breakthrough that resulted in him being identified as the “Moore Park Rapist” and “Night Stalker”.

Cameron, now 61, this week pleaded guilty to the historic rapes of eight women at knifepoint in the early 1990s and the full story can finally be revealed.

“ONE BIG F*** UP SINCE I WAS BORN”

Cameron was born in 1964 and raised in Merrylands in Sydney’s west by his grandmother.

He attended Hilltop Road Public School and then Parramatta High.

But as he later told police: “My life has been one big f*** up since I was born, you know.”

According to documents tendered to the NSW Local Court, he enlisted in the army, but said he “went off the rails” due to a drug habit.

For a time, he was homeless and slept in a car.

He met a woman and had two children together in 1982 and 1983, but that relationship ended after four years.

He worked at Lidcombe Hospital as a carer for patients with paraplegia and quadriplegia and, in the early 1990s, married another woman who had moved to Australia from Taiwan.

But, he later told police, that relationship began to fall apart because of his drug problem, and he admitted to using marijuana, speed and cocaine and regularly went on “benders”.

Around that time, he began a reign of terror over the city of Sydney but remained in the shadows for 30 years.

He had two children with the woman - born in 1993 and 1998.

However his marriage ended abruptly in the early 2000s he left the family home and never returned, abandoning his children.

Throughout his life, Cameron worked in funeral homes, as a wardsman and in a sex shop.

HIS REIGN OF TERROR

Cameron’s first victim was a Japanese tourist, who he approached after she got off a train at Strathfield station, in Sydney’s inner west on the evening of April 14, 1991.

He asked to see a ticket and produced a police badge, before asking her to follow him out of the station.

The victim had never seen a police badge before, and believed it was real.

He led her into a laneway where he produced a knife and raped the then 27-year-old woman.

He told her to count to 100 as he walked away.

The woman reported the sexual assault to a friend, who was a doctor, and several days later she went to police.

In what would be the first piece in the puzzle in Cameron’s eventual capture more than 30 years later, DNA was found on the skirt she was wearing that evening.

Cameron’s raped his second victim 11 months later when he approached a woman outside a Surry Hills bar.

“Hey I’m an art student, I think you’re really attractive. Would you like to do some modelling?” he told the woman, who was lighting a cigarette.

The 24-year-old woman responded: “f*** off”.

She began to walk away down Cleveland Street, but he pressed a knife to her back and led her to Moore Park Golf Course where he raped her.

She ran home hysterical before her housemate called triple-0.

From there his offending escalated as he raped a further six victims across eight months from September 1992 to May 1993.

His modus operandi was often the same - offering his victims “cleaning work” before attacking them.

He lured one victim with the offer of a modelling job where she would meet “all kinds of stars” and work on an advertisement for the 2000 Olympics.

Police began a public appeal to identify the predator.

One of his victims provided description of the man and police issued a sketch of the rapist.

Police were inundated with calls from the public about the case, by which time was known as the “Moore Park Rapist” and the “Night Stalker”.

A task force was set up and police began patrolling Moore Park Golf Course, as well as looking into cleaners in the area.

But after no further victims came forward and some persons of interest were excluded, the task force was wound up in July 1993.

THE DNA TEST

Cameron claimed that he turned his life around after he met his current wife in about 2008 or 2009.

They moved to Thailand before returning to Australia in 2012 where he worked in a funeral parlour in Alice Springs.

He worked at a funeral home as funeral director up until his arrest.

Little did he know that in 2022 NSW Police began a review of the historic rapes in Moore Park, Stanmore, Ashfield and Strathfield.

Police established that four of his victims were connected because of DNA found on their clothing.

A search of the national criminal investigator DNA database established that a woman living in WA may be related to the predator.

And police then obtained a search warrant for hospital records, which revealed that Cameron was the woman’s father.

From there, his house of cards began to crumble.

Records established that he was living in Parramatta and Burwood at the time of the offences, and police tracked him to Alice Springs where he was then living.

THE HOTEL BAR, THE SCHOONER AND THE SECRET POLICE OPERATION

NSW Police notified Northern Territory counterparts that they were looking at Cameron as a person of interest.

They got their big break when they were notified that Cameron, with his wife, were booked on a flight to Bangkok, Thailand with a one-night stopover in Sydney.

From there officers sprang into action and pulled off a covert operation that was like something out of the movies.

They had eyes on him as he touched down in Sydney. 

He checked into the Rydges Hotel attached to the airport and he was seen eating a meal at the hotel bar.

When he left, police took possession of a fork and schooner that he had used.

Officers then searched his room and obtained other items for DNA testing after he had left for Bangkok.

Six days later, while he was still overseas, test results matched his DNA to the “Moore Park Rapist”, giving police enough evidence to arrest him.

When he arrived back in Australia at 7.30am on February 29 on board flight QF24, Australian Border Force and Australian Federal Police were waiting, who took him into a room where he was met by NSW Police.

He was handcuffed and taken into custody and recorded a police interview. His wife was not accused of any wrongdoing or knowledge of his crimes.

When he was later told by police that his DNA matched that found on the skirt of his first victim, Cameron lied saying: “OK it would have been a consensual sexual encounter. I’ve never done something like that ever.”

Over a year and a half on, Cameron on Wednesday sat in a cell in Long Bay jail, sporting white hair and glasses, as he admitted to being a serial rapist.

Appearing in a Sydney court via videolink, his lawyer entered guilty pleas to 11 counts of aggravated sexual assault, one count of attempted aggravated sexual assault and one count of indecent assault.

He has also admitted to a further 14 charges - six counts of indecent assault, five counts of aggravated sexual assault, two counts of attempted aggravated sexual assault and one count of detain for advantage - that will be taken into account on sentence.

He will now appear before the NSW District Court for sentencing proceedings where his victims will have a chance to deliver victim impact statements.

Though one of his victims has since died, according to court documents.

He will appear in court again on October 24.",For 30 years the Moore Park Rapist got away with his crimes.

364082496,Key detail for Australia in new Trump tariff,"The US President this week confirmed he would follow through with his pledge to slap tariffs on foreign-made pharmaceuticals after first threatening action in July.

Australian pharmaceutical exports to the US were worth north of $2bn in 2024.

But Mr Butler on Sunday played down concerns, pointing out that Mr Trump himself said there would be exemptions.

“The vast bulk of our exports to the US are actually blood and plasma products, so it’s not entirely clear whether they are captured by the scope of the announcement the President made a few days ago,” Mr Butler told Sky News. 

“Also, the President said there would be exemptions from those very high tariffs of 100 per cent if a company was involved in capital investment in the US.

“And the major exporter of our blood and plasma products is in the process of building even more facilities in the US than they already operate there, with many, many thousands of employees … in the United States undertaking that blood and plasma products work.”

Though, he added “it’s certainly not nothing” and that there “are some medicine exporters that may be captured by these tariffs”.

“The US is an important first market … for start up medicine companies, because getting access to (Federal Drug Administration) approval is terrifically important in terms of global exposure to for a new medicine,” Mr Butler said. 

“But we are trying to understand this impact a little bit more.

“We do think that there’s a very high likelihood the major exporter that accounts for the vast bulk of our exports to the US will not be captured by this new announcement, either because of the nature of their product or because of the capital investment they’re undertaking right now in the US.”

364082492,Albo’s huge call on Aussie republic,"The King hosted the Prime Minister at Balmoral Castle on Saturday for a “rather wonderful lunch”, as Mr Albanese described it to the ABC.

In an interview broadcast on Sunday, he was asked if he had raised the idea of an Australian republic with the monarch.

“No, and I think I’ve made it clear that I wanted to hold one referendum while I was prime minister, and we did that,” Mr Albanese told the national broadcaster, referencing his failed referendum on a Voice to Parliament.

“We did that, and I think we’re concentrating on cost of living, and on making a real practical difference to people’s lives.”

Asked if he thought it “strange” that he had had to venture to Scotland to “visit the King of Australia”, Mr Albanese said, “Of course,” adding that King Charles “is fully aware that I support an Australian as our head of state”.

“But I also respect the decisions which have been made and our system of government, and I think that’s important,” he said. 

“If you look at the way that I conduct myself, I always support the institutions which are there.”

Pressed further on the role of the Royal Family in modern Australia, he said he thought they still held a “great deal of respect” in the country.

“Their majesties, when they visited Australia recently, King Charles and Queen Camilla were very well received,” Mr Albanese said. 

“They work hard. They’re interested in our place in the world.

“They’re very interested in the Commonwealth ... and I think they are respected.”

364077162,‘Juicy’ story behind new Netflix series,"On Tuesday this week in London they gathered and posed for the press: The Earl; the socialite reportedly pushed in a pool by Kate Moss; the famed fashion eccentric, muse, and Bowie protege; and the muso who formed a punk rock band with Osama bin Laden’s niece. 

These are the Guinnesses, or at least some of them, members of the famed, monied, and eccentric brewing dynasty, whose story has been turned into Netflix’s new House of Guinness. Think Downton Abbey meets a malted Succession in corsets set against the backdrop of the violent political unrest of 1860s Ireland. What could possibly go wrong? 

While the clan might be most famous for their patriarch’s famous boozy creation, their true story is far wilder, weirder and more shocking than anything that has ended up on the small screen. 

Forget sex, drugs and titles; their story is about LSD, Hitler, diamonds, The Beatles, a terrorist group assassination, Greek shipping billions, James Bond, Prussian royalty and a supposed curse that has seen a series of family members meet terrible, dramatic fates. 

In 1930, the editor of Debrett’s peergage guide described them as “The most complicated family in the book.” If only they could see them now. 

How it all started 

In 1759 founder Arthur had the cracking idea to make a particularly dark stout and such was his belief in his drop that he signed a 9000-year-lease on a brewery in Dublin. His tipple went down a charm and by the time he died in 1803, he was richer than King George III, had had 21 children, only 11 of whom survived him.

(“A friend once told me they were at a party with a host of the twenty-something Guinnesses,” family biographer Emily Hourian recently wrote “and there was a whole lot of ‘so your grandfather is my great-uncle’. Even they struggled to connect the dots.”)

The title came in 1919 when George V made Edward Cecil Guinness the first Earl of Iveagh, thus officially lobbing them into the nobility. 

How many are there today?

So sprawling is their family tree that there are so many Guinnesses that, the saying goes, in West London you’re never more than six feet from one of them. In Ireland, the family is reportedly the closest thing the country has to royalty. 

In 1997, the Guinness company was one of the two biggest alcohol companies in the world and was worth $20 billion when it was merged with. The family’s current head, Lord Ivan Iveagh is reportedly worth at least $1.8 billion today. 

Tell me about Guinnesses on the red carpet

I’m so glad you asked. Prepare yourself, more names are about to be dropped than exist in Tina Brown’s bulging 80s Rolodex. 

At the Netflix premiere was Lady Mary Charteris, just the latest in a long line of It Girls the family has been producing for over a century. In 2012, she married Robbie Furze in a cut-out wedding dress, which the British papers got right excited about. 

She is the daughter of Catherine Guinness who, in the 70s, was Andy Warhol’s personal assistant, who starred alongside him in the film Cocaine Cowboys, and was the muse of famed photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Lady Mary’s father James Charteris is the Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March and was a Page of Honour to the Queen Mother.

Lady Mary has found her way into the headlines: In 2015, Kate Moss allegedly pushed her into a swimming pool because the supermodel was “so furious” at seeing Lady Mary talking to her then husband Jamie Hince, the Daily Mail claimed. 

The bestseller House of Beckham reported that in 2017, David Beckham didn’t answer his wife Victoria’s calls because he was out until 5am partying with Lady Mary and his friend Dave Gardner at Glastonbury. 

Then we get to the most famous modern Guinness, Daphne.

The granddaughter of Diana Mitford (later Mosley), she married into the even richer Niarchos shipping dynasty as a teenager, went on to become a muse to Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld, turned her hand to music after being mentored by David Bowie who ‘shadow produced’ her first album, and is besties with La Moss.

Daphne spent part of her childhood at a former Spanish monastery bought by her father that had no running water or electricity and with Salvador Dali as a neighbour. When she was five years old, a schizophrenic held her at knifepoint at the family’s Kensington home while he shouted “death to women”. (“I remember being marched through this house with a knife at my neck, bleeding and cut,” she told the Guardian in 2023.) 

While Daphne survived, her attacker would kill his mother later that day.

Daphne was close to her beloved maternal grandmother, Lady Diana Mosley, who married her second husband, Sir Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, at the house of Joseph Goebbels. Adolf Hitler was a guest. 

Daphne married Spyros Niarchos, an heir of the $33 billion Niarchos shipping fortune, when she was 19. (As a teenager she was reportedly courted by David Cholmondeley, the wealthy Earl of Rocksavage, now the Marquess of Cholmondeley, who is part of Prince William and Kate, The Prince and Princess of Wales’ set.)

In 1999 Daphne and Spyros divorced and she began a relationship with famed French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy who remained married throughout their relationship, calling him the love of her life, before, according to one report, her having getting back together with Spyros. 

There is eccentricity and then there is Daphne. According to the New Yorker, she wears 17th century Qing dynasty robes day-to-day and pristine white ballet slippers to work out, has a 20 metre entirely mirrored hallway in her New York apartment, and spent five years co-creating a glove made out of five thousand pavé diamonds worth $2.6 million which she debuted at a party where she posed as a sort of corpse bride for the night. 

In more recent years, QAnon came for Daphne when the conspiracy loons claimed she was in league with the devil and drank the blood of children, the Guardian has reported, after she was photographed holding a glass of what was actually tomato juice.

The Earl, the model, and the author

Bloody hell. That’s just two of them. What about the rest?

The only chap on The House of Guinness red carpet was Arthur Edward Rory Guinness, the 4th Earl of Iveagh, who became the one of the youngest hereditary peers in the House of Lords when he inherited the title aged 23. He also got the 22,500-acre Elveden Hall estate which is reportedly the largest farm in Britain.

His ex-wife, the interior designer Clare Hazell flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane the Lolita Express 32 times between 1998 and 2000. 

Also on the red carpet was another Guinness ""It"" girl, Jasmine who in the 90s was a fashion darling in the UK and US and beloved by Mario Testino. Her 2006 wedding at her family’s 12th century Irish castle Leixlip was the wedding of the aughties. 

Standing next to him was descendant Ivana Lowell, who we have to thank for the Netflix series. 

Years ago she was staying with cousin Desmond Guinness, who was once married to Princess Henriette Marie-Gabrielle von Urach and is Jasmine’s grandfather, at his Palladian Irish mansion watching Downton Abbey. She realised, “Our family history was a lot juicier and more interesting than this – plus it was all true,” she recently told the BBC.

Lowell wrote a treatment of her family’s story and Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight came on board; The House of Guinness focuses on their fortunes in the 19th century.

Lowell’s personal story is dramatic. Six-years-old, she received third degree burns to 70 per cent of her body after an accident with a kettle, she was sexually abused by her nanny’s husband, her mother the famed novelist Lady Caroline Blackwood was alcoholic and her sister Natalya died of a heroin overdose aged 18. Lowell’s therapist said to her, per The Times, “Oh my God, that’s one of the worst stories I’ve ever heard.”

(Blackwood was introduced to her first husband, artist Lucian Freud, by Ian Fleming’s wife.)

In the 90s Lowell reportedly briefly tried acting, getting a cameo in Goldeneye, before writing a memoir. “We had this family expression ‘this is too bad even for us’ — like when my mum got cancer,” Lowell told The Times recently. 

And last but by no means least, Celeste Guinness who formed an all-female post-punk band, Deep Tan, which included Osama bin Laden’s niece Wafah Dufour. (Dufour has denounced her uncle.)

At The House of Guinness’ premiere she wore a black satin suit adorned with Guinness-themed patches which she then opened to reveal she was wearing nothing underneath. 

The Black Curse

The family is said to suffer from something dubbed ‘Black Curse’, starting with conservative politician Walter Guinness, the first Baron Moyne, who was assassinated by members of a militant Zionist group in Cairo in 1944. 

In the 60s, Patrick “Tara” Browne, son of Oonagh Guinness, was a fixture in Swinging Sixties London, partying with the Rolling Stones, and it was at his 21st birthday party, reportedly, that Paul McCartney tried his first tab of acid. He died after driving Lotus in central London at 160km/hour; McCartney and John Lennon wrote The Beatles song A Day in the Life about him. 

In 1966, Prince Frederick of Prussia, the husband of Lady Brigid Guinness, drowned in the Rhine.

Lady Henrietta Guinness, who died by suicide in 1978 reportedly said, “If I had been poor, I would have been happy.”

John Guinness, former bank chairman, died in 1998 after falling 500ft down a mountain in Wales. 

In 1998 Lady Henrietta’s niece, Rose Nugent, 31, was killed when she was thrown from her Romany caravan near after her horse bolted.

Also in the 90s, descendant Olivia Channon died of drug overdose while a student at Oxford University. In 2021 the ‘Black Curse’ was back in the news after her brother Henry Channon died aged 51. 

The new Crown?

If The House of Guinness is a success, there is no end of real life material to keep mining for series after series.

A very small taster. 

By the 30s, the family had spread into politics, banking, and society, dominating the London smart set with novelist Evelyn Waugh immortalising them as his Bright Young Things.

In 1929, Bryan Guinness and his then wife the Hon. Diana Mitford were part of an elaborate art world spoof putting on an exhibition of faked modernist paintings for small fortunes. In 1936 Diana married Sir Oswald while Adolf looked on.

(Diana’s sister Unity Mitford moved to Berlin and joined Hitler’s inner circle, killing herself after Britain declared war on Germany.)

In the 70s Sabrina Guinness, from the banking side, dated Prince Charles and Mick Jagger before marrying the world’s most famous playwright, Tom Stoppard.

There’s more – so much more. 

And unlike other famous dynasties, there is a certain degree of openness. As Ivana Lowell recently told the BBC, “We are not high and mighty about our reputation, we have a very good sense of humour about ourselves”. They’d need to.

364077160,Aussie model blasts dating rumours,"In a new interview with the Stellar podcast Something To Talk About, Gomes said she had previously been interviewed in a way that “put a lot of attention on who you are dating and your love life”.

Gomes’ response came when podcast host Sarrah Le Marquand asked her to “call out any questions that you think [the media] should stop asking women”.

The Byron Bay-based actor and model continued: “I feel like that’s very personal to women and I definitely feel like … it should be about what women are achieving,” Gomes said on the new episode of Something To Talk About, out today.

“I’ve always been a little bit frustrated with [how] there’s been so much interest on who I’m dating.

“It’s like, ‘OK … this is what I’m doing, and this is when I’m talking to you guys about, so let’s just focus on what I am creating versus who I’m dating.

“I get the interest. They’re trying to sell a story. But I think people just need to be a little bit more kinder.”

Listen to Jessica Gomes on the Stellar podcast, Something To Talk About: 

Gomes – who turned 40 last week and appears on the cover of the latest issue of Stellar, shot in her adopted home of Byron – said she “felt bad” when watching interviews with “women where they [are] introverted … and they feel like they’ve been tripped up by an interview’.

“Especially with someone that is an artist or someone that’s in the public eye and has worked really hard [for] what they’re doing,” Gomes told Le Marquand.

“And then in an interview, they can feel like they are disrespected. I always feel like it’s not fair.”

Listen to Jessica Gomes on the Stellar podcast, Something To Talk About: 

The former face of David Jones also called out the scrutiny on women’s bodies, referencing British actor Kate Winslet – who has publicly spoken about being savaged by the media early in her career about her weight, particularly in the aftermath of mega hit movie, Titanic.

“I feel like that’s very … disrespectful,” Gomes said on Something To Talk About.

“To comment on someone’s weight in an interview or say something like an underlying little dig.”

Gomes also addressed the pressure she has sometimes felt to conform to beauty standards, admitting she had tried anti-wrinkle injections and that “I didn’t like it”.

“I think ageing is a beautiful thing. I think having a few little wrinkles here and there is fine,” Gomes said, as she enters a new decade. 

“I just think you have to own it. You have to own where you’re at in life.”

364078636,The best movies and TV series you can watch for free,"Heads up fans of The Substance, that satirical body horror has an ancestor in 1988 black comedy Society. High school senior Bill (Billy Warlock) is living a privileged life with his parents in Beverly Hills. Beautiful girlfriend, sports star, never-ending cash — everything is perfect, except for the fact his family and all their wealthy friends are part of a murderous alien death cult (pobody's nerfect?).

Trashed upon original release due to its over-the-top gore (shout out SFX luminary Screaming Mad George), director Brian Yuzna's pointed satire on class warfare and the insatiable appetites of the wealthy has only become more relevant over the past 30 years. Inspired by the art of Salvador Dalí, the movie's final scene is even more gruesome than The Substances' bloodbath finale — you won't be able to shake the image of Bill's family and neighbours ""shunting"" for a long time.

Back in 1970s Australia, there was no TV show more controversial than Number 96. The saucy soap opera concerning the salacious lives of couples living in a Sydney apartment block was even heralded with the tagline ""Tonight, Australian television loses its virginity"".

In addition to the titillation, the show also broke incredible ground for LGBTQIA+ representation on TV, including the first gay kiss on Australian TV (years before homosexuality was decriminalised in NSW) and the first transgender TV character Robyn Ross, played by legendary trans cabaret performer Carlotta. Number 96 covered everything from drug addiction, interracial relationships and abortion to S&M relationships. With a whopping 1,218 episodes produced (and more than a few becoming lost media), dip into this trailblazing piece of Australiana while you can.

Smoking Causes Coughing

Smoking Causes Coughing is unlike any film you've ever seen. Which is not surprising considering it came from the brain of Quentin Dupieux, the French filmmaker who broke into the scene with a movie about a killer tyre. Smoking Causes Coughing is somewhat of an anthology, as we follow the superhero crew Tobacco Force (whose powers extend to killing their foes with a collection of fatal cigarette smoke) to a cohesion retreat after an embarrassing loss to a giant turtle creature.

The team teases out a selection of surreal stories around a campfire that range from silly to immensely silly, with some garish gore thrown in for good measure. Fans of provocateurs like Monty Python will find themselves giddy at Dupieux's commitment to immaturity.

Whatever the Wallabies’ coaches and leaders are saying before Test matches isn’t working. The slow start at Eden Park was the fifth such occasion this year — the first British and Irish Lions Test, the Test against the Springboks at Ellis Park, both Tests against Argentina, and now the Bledisloe opener.

That’s a horrible trend, and it feels like the side is subconsciously putting so much faith in the bench that the opening quarter isn’t seen as critical.

This is the story of how Payne Haas defied the odds","It’s difficult for Haas to speak about his parents in such a way as he knows it will anger some people, given the impact they have had on the lives of others. He doesn’t expect sympathy and says life has exposed him to things no child should see.

It’s the driving force behind his desire to give his two children and the two brothers he has taken in the life he wished he had.

“I don’t want my kids to grow up in the environment I grew up around,” he said.

“I’m trying to keep them away from that life. I want them to grow up in a house where we’re all loving, we’re all respectful. I’ve seen things that I wouldn’t wish on anyone, even my worst enemy. I don’t want that for my kids. I just want them to see their parents love each other, they care about them and they want them to do good in life.

“I’ve seen lots of people in my life go down the wrong road. Especially some of my cousins and close friends. They were probably more talented than me, but probably went down the wrong road. I feel like I’ve learnt from their mistakes and try to make that up for them by carrying them on my shoulders.”

Haas wasn’t always destined to be a footballer.

It wasn’t until the age of 14, after rigorous training set by his father, that he began to excel in a sport he now dominates.

“From 7 to 11, I sucked,” he admits.

“My mum hated it. She used to take me to games and I’d see my mum pacing up and down, and I knew I would cop a serve on the way home. My dad made me train hard after that. I started to get good around 14. My dad worked me hard. I owe a lot to him, but I also resented my dad a lot.

“Every morning and every afternoon, I’d be training, doing hills. My dad used to be a sprinter and a hurdler. He went to the Pan Pacific Games as a kid. So he used to train me hard. He also was in the military for a bit, so he was pretty [disciplined]. He would drop us off at random places 6km away and tell us to run home.”

“My dad used to say, ‘You don’t want to be a typical Polynesian and be all power, your fitness has to be number one.’ At the time, I hated it. I was a little fatty. I just wanted to go to my grandparents’ house to eat corned beef.”

Some regard Haas as the greatest front-rower of the modern era, if not all-time. Yet, there is a glaring absence in his resume, compared to the likes of Shane Webcke, Petero Civoniceva and Glenn Lazarus.

“I feel like I do need a [premiership] ring to have that name next to me,” he responds when asked about his potential mantle as the greatest prop of the modern era.

“To have that accolade, it puts you up another level. That’s what I’m chasing now. I feel like I’ve achieved everything individually and in rep teams.

364076914,"His brother died, his parents are in jail. This is the story of how Payne Haas defied the odds","It’s difficult for Haas to speak about his parents in such a way as he knows it will anger some people, given the impact they have had on the lives of others. He doesn’t expect sympathy and says life has exposed him to things no child should see.

It’s the driving force behind his desire to give his two children and the two brothers he has taken in the life he wished he had.

“I don’t want my kids to grow up in the environment I grew up around,” he said.

“I’m trying to keep them away from that life. I want them to grow up in a house where we’re all loving, we’re all respectful. I’ve seen things that I wouldn’t wish on anyone, even my worst enemy. I don’t want that for my kids. I just want them to see their parents love each other, they care about them and they want them to do good in life.

“I’ve seen lots of people in my life go down the wrong road. Especially some of my cousins and close friends. They were probably more talented than me, but probably went down the wrong road. I feel like I’ve learnt from their mistakes and try to make that up for them by carrying them on my shoulders.”

Haas wasn’t always destined to be a footballer.

It wasn’t until the age of 14, after rigorous training set by his father, that he began to excel in a sport he now dominates.

“From 7 to 11, I sucked,” he admits.

“My mum hated it. She used to take me to games and I’d see my mum pacing up and down, and I knew I would cop a serve on the way home. My dad made me train hard after that. I started to get good around 14. My dad worked me hard. I owe a lot to him, but I also resented my dad a lot.

“Every morning and every afternoon, I’d be training, doing hills. My dad used to be a sprinter and a hurdler. He went to the Pan Pacific Games as a kid. So he used to train me hard. He also was in the military for a bit, so he was pretty [disciplined]. He would drop us off at random places 6km away and tell us to run home.”

“My dad used to say, ‘You don’t want to be a typical Polynesian and be all power, your fitness has to be number one.’ At the time, I hated it. I was a little fatty. I just wanted to go to my grandparents’ house to eat corned beef.”

Some regard Haas as the greatest front-rower of the modern era, if not all-time. Yet, there is a glaring absence in his resume, compared to the likes of Shane Webcke, Petero Civoniceva and Glenn Lazarus.

“I feel like I do need a [premiership] ring to have that name next to me,” he responds when asked about his potential mantle as the greatest prop of the modern era.

“To have that accolade, it puts you up another level. That’s what I’m chasing now. I feel like I’ve achieved everything individually and in rep teams.

“The ring is the final thing I’m missing. We’ve got the squad. We just have to go after it. On our day, no one wants to play us.”

364078656,"No word on Donald Trump's Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan, says Hamas","Israeli strikes and gunfire have killed at least 59 people across Gaza in the past day, according to health officials.

It comes a day after US President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday, local time, ""it's looking like we have a deal on Gaza"".

He did not give details, but is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.

Mr Trump also said talks on Gaza with Middle Eastern nations were intense and would continue as long as required.

His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the US president had presented proposals to the leaders of multiple Muslim-majority countries this week that included a 21-point Middle East peace plan.

Mr Trump told reporters he believed the US was close to achieving a deal that ""will get the hostages back"" and ""end the war"".

In Gaza, meanwhile, the fighting continued.

Mr Netanyahu is opposed to ending the war until Hamas is destroyed.

Hamas said it had not seen Mr Trump's ceasefire plan.

The comments came after Israeli newspaper Haaretz cited sources saying Hamas had agreed in principle to release all the Israeli hostages it holds in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and the gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops under Mr Trump's plan.

Also included in the proposal were the end of Hamas rule in Gaza, and Israel agreeing not to annex the territory and drive out Palestinians living there, Haaretz reported.

""Hamas has not been presented with any plan,"" a Hamas official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.

Israel expands Gaza assault

Among the 59 people killed on Saturday were those hit by two strikes in the Nuseirat refugee camp — nine from the same family in a house and, later, 15 in the same camp, including women and children, according to staff at Al Awda Hospital, where the bodies were brought.

Five others were killed when a strike hit a tent for the displaced, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the dead.

Strikes also demolished a house in Gaza City's Tufah neighbourhood, killing at least 11 people, more than half of them women and children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, where the bodies were brought.

Four other people were killed when an air strike hit their homes in the Shati refugee camp, according to Shifa Hospital.

Six other Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire while seeking aid in southern and central Gaza, according to the Nasser and Al Awda hospitals.

Israel's army said it was not aware of anyone being killed by gunfire on Saturday in southern Gaza, nor of a strike in the Nuseirat area during the time and at the location provided by the hospital.

The director of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City told The Associated Press that medical teams there were concerned about Israeli ""tanks approaching the vicinity of the hospital,"" restricting access to the facility where 159 patients are being treated.

""The bombardment has not stopped for a single moment,"" Dr Mohamed Abu Selmiya said.

He added that 14 premature babies were treated in incubators in Helou Hospital, though the head of neonatal intensive care there, Nasser Bulbul, has said that the facility's main gate was closed because of drones flying over the building.

More than 300,000 people have fled Gaza City, which is experiencing famine, but up to 700,000 remain, many because they can't afford to relocate.

Pressure grows on Netanyahu to end the war

The attacks came after a defiant Mr Netanyahu told fellow world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Friday that his nation ""must finish the job"" against Hamas in Gaza. Forty-eight hostages are still held captive there, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive.

Mr Netanyahu's words began after dozens of delegates from multiple nations walked out of the UN General Assembly Hall en masse on Friday morning.

""You were like the last of the lepers. Netanyahu, we promise you that if you don't bring a comprehensive agreement and end the war, you will forever be a leper,"" said Itzik Horn, the father of Eitan Horn, one of the hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack that started the war. He was referencing the UN speech and Israel's isolation.

""My son Eitan sleeps sick and starving on the floor of a tunnel in Gaza or, worse, is used as a human shield against IDF fighters. What will you save him with?"" Mr Horn added Saturday evening.

International pressure on Israel to end the war is increasing, with a growing list of countries deciding recently to recognise Palestinian statehood, which Israel rejects.

Countries have been lobbying Mr Trump to press Israel for a ceasefire.

Hospitals are short on supplies and targeted by air strikes

Hospitals and health clinics in Gaza City are on the brink of collapse. Nearly two weeks into the latest offensive, two clinics have been destroyed by air strikes, two hospitals shut down after being damaged, and others are struggling with medicine, equipment, food and fuel in short supply, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

On Friday, aid group Doctors Without Borders said it was forced to suspend activities in Gaza City. The group said Israeli tanks were less than a kilometre from its facilities, creating an ""unacceptable level of risk"" for its staff.

Israel has also halted aid deliveries through its crossing into northern Gaza since September 12, and has increasingly rejected UN requests to bring supplies from southern Gaza into the north, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, said on Saturday that humanitarian aid to the northern Gaza Strip ""continues on an ongoing basis,"" and that it has increased significantly over recent weeks at a crossing into central Gaza.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 65,900 people and wounded more than 167,000 others, Gaza's Health Ministry said. It did not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but said women and children make up around half the fatalities. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but UN agencies and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

Israel's campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.","Israeli strikes and gunfire have killed at least 59 people across Gaza in the past day, according to health officials.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/no-word-on-donald-trump-s-israel-gaza-ceasefire-plan-says-hamas/105825646,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/eef323eaf8bf112b74b3c290cf73ad9c?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=460&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 23:18:44,ABC News,['ABC News'],en,politics,AU,-0.264
364078650,Vanished Aboriginal leader's family calls for probe into alleged killer,"When Dhakiyarr Wirrpanda disappeared in 1934 after being cleared of the murder of an NT police officer and spared the hangman's noose, many suspected the slain officer's colleagues had finished the job.

Almost a century later, his descendants are asking the NT government to finally make amends for the historic injustice.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name and image of a person who has died, used with the permission of his family.

When Dhakiyarr Wirrpanda walked from Darwin's Fannie Bay Gaol a free man on November 9, 1934, he stood at a crossroads in Australia's colonial history.

After being sentenced to death for the murder of Northern Territory police officer Albert McColl the previous year, Dhakiyarr became the first Indigenous person to have his case heard in the High Court.

Ruling the trial ""a substantial and grave injustice"", the court acquitted Dhakiyarr and he was released, free to return to his East Arnhem Land community of Dhuruputjpi, where he remained the revered leader of the Dhudi-Djapu clan.

But within 24 hours Dhakiyarr had vanished without a trace — widely rumoured to have been murdered by police officers driven by revenge for their fallen comrade.

More than 90 years later, an ABC investigation has shed new light on the possible identity of Dhakiyarr's killer, and after decades of waiting, his family are calling on authorities to revisit one of the territory's oldest unsolved mysteries.

'Investigation deficiency'

NT Coroner Elisabeth Armitage handed down her long-awaited findings into Dhakiyarr's disappearance in March this year without holding an inquest, after ruling he was not ""in custody"" at the time of his death.

Judge Armitage found that while there was ""a motive for a then serving member or members of the Northern Territory Police Force to harm Dhakiyarr"", there was no reliable evidence that any of them acted on it.

""In the absence of any living witnesses, forensic evidence, or a body, there is very little scope for establishing accurate facts when it comes to either of the commonly postulated scenarios,"" the coroner wrote.

As part of the inquiry, investigators interviewed historian and former NT administrator Teg Egan, whose book on the case, Justice All Their Own, was published in 1996.

In researching the book, a witness told Mr Egan she overheard a ""particular policeman"" confessing to Dhakiyarr's murder, saying he and two other police officers ""took him out [to] Darwin Harbour and shot him"".

In a recorded interview in September last year, Mr Egan told cold case detective Glen Chatto he did not name the alleged confessor in the book after the witness, who had agreed to sign a statutory declaration attesting to what she heard, died before she was able to do so.

Chatto: So with this information that you've, you have at the moment, has [it] ever been reported to police?Egan: No, you are the first, uh, serving policeman that I've ever had any discussion with.Chatto: So are you willing to disclose the name of the police officer that Mrs Wilson told you?Egan: Not to you, no, not, not to you today.

It was what Judge Armitage described in her report as an ""investigation deficiency"", with Acting Sergeant Chatto conceding in his interview with Mr Egan that ""without a name, there's not much more I can do"".

""I guess from my perspective, if you, if you were to give me a name,"" the transcript reads.

However, when Acting Sergeant Chatto asked Mr Egan if he ever discussed the allegation with the officer, he told him no, but he had known him in another context.

""Do you know the real origin of the Berrimah line?"" he asked, referring to an invisible boundary said by Darwin locals to divide the city from the bush.

""Well [laugh], I'm giving my, giving myself away [here]. But anyway, there was a line painted on the road at, on the highway at Berrimah.""At which point no-hopers, or people, undesirables in town, were taken in the police truck, and taken a step beyond that, given the boot up, a physical boot up the [arse].""On your way, son. Don't ever come back. And that was, that was the Berrimah line.""

Dhakiyarr's songline

In Yolŋu culture, the bones of a deceased elder hold special significance for those left behind, and must be returned to country under traditional law to help sustain the community.

With Dhakiyarr's remains still missing, Dhuruputjpi now lies all but abandoned, outside the remote community of Baniyala on the shores of Blue Mud Bay.

His next of kin and current Dhudi-Djapu clan leader, Dhukal Wirrpanda, has always believed Dhakiyarr was ""shot and he was hidden somewhere in Darwin"".

""If he's in Darwin just show me please, every law, every ngapaki (non-Indigenous person) that knows about this story, tell,"" he says.

After almost a century, it's impossible to prove the ""particular policeman"" known for giving undesirables his signature send-off at the Berrimah line confessed as claimed, let alone that he actually killed Dhakiyarr.

As a result, the ABC has chosen not to name the officer publicly; but after learning his identity, Mr Wirrpanda wants investigators to pursue the new line of inquiry.

""I want my father, whatever he's done, I want him back,"" he says.

Dhakiyarr's grandson and Madarrpa clan leader Djambawa Marawili says regardless of where the truth lies, the moment presents an opportunity to reclaim some of the justice Dhakiyarr lost when he was denied the benefit of his acquittal.

Both men want to see the territory government help establish a makarrata and reconciliation centre in Dhakiyarr's name, where his descendants can share their knowledge of culture and law, to foster understanding between Yolŋu and ngapaki.

""The things should come out into the public for the world to see, it's about where Dhakiyarr has lost his life,"" he says.

A death in custody?

Filmmaker Tom Murray has stayed in regular contact with Dhakiyarr's family since directing the documentary Dhakiyarr vs The King, in which they reconciled with Constable McColl's family in a wukidi ceremony in 2003.

He says the coroner's finding that Dhakiyarr was not in custody when he disappeared from Darwin's notorious Kahlin Compound, where Indigenous people were required to stay after sunset at the time, is unjustifiable.

""I think that what people have been hungering for is justice and what the coroner's report didn't do is give people enough that felt just,"" he says.

""While it's important that the coroner looked into this issue, it's still left open for this community to experience real justice through this, so we'd hope that if this new information can be useful at all it's to help re-evaluate that in order to have a more just outcome.""

Murray says establishing a reconciliation centre and providing more funding to support Yolŋu people to live on country, including through better healthcare, housing and education, would go some way towards the territory making good on a great injustice.

""It's amazing to think about him walking around here 90 years ago, a powerful man, and he left to go to Darwin to face justice,"" he says.

""So I hope that maybe with this little bit of information, maybe with a stronger sense that the responsibility lies with the state in terms of this — whichever way you look at it — that we can get an outcome that works well for this community because they've been waiting a long time for it.""

During his interview with Mr Egan last year, Acting Sergeant Chatto admitted that if the same thing happened today, the official response might have been different.

Egan: ""If I was in the police force, it'd be the last thing I'd want, to be [a] coronial inquiry. 'So, uh, one of our fellas fixed him. We took him out in the harbour and we showed him, as you do.' As you don't.""Chatto: ""Well, yeah, that's right. I, I guess it, if it happened now, [there would] be a, a massive investigation.""

An NT government spokesperson said: ""We will take Dhukal Wirrpanda's [reconciliation centre] proposal into consideration and will refer it to the relevant department for review.""

Judge Armitage did not respond to a request for comment.

364074694,Anthony Albanese downplays concerns ahead of White House meet with Donald Trump,"Anthony Albanese has played down concerns chasmic differences between himself and Donald Trump will make for an uncomfortable meeting with the US President next month.

The Prime Minister will return to the US in later October for a face-to-face with Mr Trump at the White House.

The highly anticipated meet will take place nearly a year after Mr Trump’s historic presidential come back, with Mr Albanese under fire for not having secured a meeting earlier.

Amid criticism from the Coalition he has jeopardised the Australia-US relationship by not visiting sooner, Mr Albanese was asked on Sunday (AEST) if he had any “trepidation” about the meeting.

“No, not at all,” he told Sky News.

“The discussions we’ve had have been very positive and constructive, and Australia and United States are great friends.

“We pull our weight and … it’s not a relationship of unequals.”

He went on to say the US “is obviously the largest economy in the world, the most powerful country in the world, but Australia always we punch way above our weight”.

He also said he has “had a number of discussions with people in the administration”, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Mr Bessent is key to rolling out Mr Trump’s “America First” vision.

The two leaders briefly met earlier this week at a reception Mr Trump hosted in New York.

Mr Albanese even snapped a selfie with him.

364078640,Small bull rider with a 'big heart' takes on the world's best,"In a huge dark hat and shining belt buckle, this 10-year-old kid from Kowanyama knows what he loves.

From one of Queensland's most remote towns, on the west coast of Cape York, Carl Douglas Jr has heard the enticing roar of a rodeo crowd in Utah in the west of the United States.

The pint-sized champion loves riding mini bulls, and he can now say he has done it in front of the world.

Starting in the sport only two years ago, he quickly proved himself a talent in the ring, winning medals around the Queensland circuit.

It was at one of these regional rodeos that Carl was spotted and chosen to represent Australia on the global stage at the International Mini Bull Riding Association World Finals.

With the support of his town, Carl and his parents made the long journey from their home, 600 kilometres north-west of Cairns, to Utah earlier this month.

His father, Carl Douglas Snr, was a bronco rider himself back in the day, and said it was an incredible experience not just for his family but for the eight other children chosen to compete from across the country.

""In Australia it's small, but when you get over there on the other side of the world, the things are bigger, there's more riders … it was eye-catching,"" he said.

'He can ride these American bulls'

Carl Jr is a softly spoken but confident boy who knows just what pose to strike with his cowboy shirt and shades.

He said the US rodeo scene was ""strange"" to him, but he still found it easy to focus.

""Much more crowded and more riders,"" he said.

His mother, Valma Beatrice Lawrence, said despite watching Carl Jr enter the ring many times, the American bulls made her nervous.

""My heart was pounding and I didn't know what to do and I just sort of sat there and I prayed for him while I was sitting there,"" she said.

""Then when I saw him come out on this bull, I thought, 'Oh, he can ride these American bulls', and he did … he did really well.""

Carl placed third in the International Mini Bull Riding Association's junior finals and seventh overall.

Jumping on with a big heart

The love of the sport also bonded Carl with other kids from around the world.

She said the kids would see each other every day and share yarns about bulls and life back home.

Aside from the rides and games at the championship, Carl Jr said meeting the other competitors and building his passion for the sport were highlights on the trip.

""I told them I was from Australia and I'm a bull rider … I love riding bulls.""

When he returned to Kowanyama, his hometown put on a welcome parade.

And Carl is already looking forward to the next time he is back in the ring.

""I'll do it for the rest of my life.""","In a huge dark hat and shining belt buckle, a 10-year-old from Cape York proves he can mix it with the best at the world finals in Utah.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/10-year-old-mini-bull-rider-competes-at-world-finals-in-utah-us/105817314,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/88f2399c3cfcba8c38270a7242f3eee7?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2332&cropW=4146&xPos=81&yPos=252&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 23:02:53,"Holly Richardson,Sharnie Kim","['Holly Richardson', 'Sharnie Kim']",en,,AU,0.441
364078662,Oasis's 'biblical' reunion is largely thanks to this blockbuster album,"Unless this is your first day on the internet, you've no doubt noticed Britpop-era icons Oasis are back together, playing their first shows in 16 years.

The tour has already netted an estimated £400 million ($815 million) before arriving in Australia in late October.

Contemporaries like Blur, Pulp, Suede, and Supergrass have all experienced their own revivals or remained active, but few seem to have captured the current moment quite like Oasis. 

""Biblical"", as the band and their fans would put it.

It is a successful comeback that has drawn much excitement. But also, derision.

Reappraisal of Oasis's legacy has caused some to wonder if they were really all that great to begin with, largely amounting to 'What if The Beatles were football hooligans?'

An op-ed in The Guardian called them ""the most damaging pop cultural force in recent British history"", blaming the Gallagher brothers' ""knuckle-dragging ideas on sexuality and politics"" for the crime of setting back social attitudes, presaging Brexit and conservative nationalism.

Indeed, the brothers' droll, foul-mouthed way with words was glamorised by tabloids, earning a reputation as large as their chart-busting songs that helped define the '90s.

Of all the reasons people are so ecstatic about an Oasis reunion, a good number of them can be found on the group's best-selling second album, (What's The Story) Morning Glory?, released 30 years ago this week.

There is, of course, the inescapable Wonderwall, the epic Champagne Supernova, the swaggering Roll With It, and swooning Don't Look Back In Anger — an instant classic inspired by a snippet of John Lennon conversation and a nod to his famous solo single.

""Aren't those two chords the same as Imagine? No shit,"" Noel Gallagher once remarked, engaged in a mock exchange with an imaginary cynic.

Love him or loathe him, he was absolutely right.

A Britpop blockbuster

Despite a muted reaction from the music press, decrying the follow-up to 1994's raw debut Definitely Maybe as generic, laddish, lazy, and ""phoney Beatlemania"", Morning Glory was hugely popular.

It wasn't just a hit. It was the fastest-selling album in the UK since Michael Jackson's Bad, eventually shifting more than 23 million copies worldwide.

""There was that moment where … we were number one in the singles [and] albums charts, consecutively for weeks,"" said Noel Gallagher.

The album spent five weeks atop the Australian charts and has since gone eight-times Platinum, its influence audible in Australian acts ranging from Jet and The Superjesus to DMA'S and Middle Kids.

""Nobody had any f***ing idea what was going to happen. I wrote the songs; I was more surprised than anyone,"" remarked Gallagher.

""I've said it many, many times, but if I had known then what I know now about just what Wonderwall would become, or Don't Look Back In Anger, I'd never finish those songs. I'd still be fiddling around with it.""

If anything, the guitarist-songwriter was anticipating a poor reception from critics, who chastised the pivot towards beer-y balladry and big, pop-friendly choruses.

The outcome was an added surprise for British media, who only a few months earlier had fuelled a rivalry between Oasis and Blur, capitalising on 'Cool Britannia' and updating the 'Rolling Stones vs Beatles' chart face-off for the '90s.

Dubbed the 'Battle of Britpop', it saw London's artsy, middle-class Blur pitted against Manchester's working-class Gallagher brothers, each releasing singles from their respective upcoming albums on the same day: August 14, 1995.

Blur's Country House would beat Roll With It to number one. Oasis may have lost the battle, but (What's The Story) Morning Glory? won them the war.

Bigger and better

Definitely Maybe introduced Oasis as the most exciting British band of the '90s, a Manchester quintet using rock'n'roll as their ticket out of their ordinary existence.

(What's The Story) Morning Glory? made them massive worldwide. An unapologetic pitch for global domination stocked with stadium-sized anthems with mass appeal that drew on familiar sources.

As Gallagher noted in a 1996 interview with Rolling Stone:

Morning Glory has the vitality and attitude of its predecessor, but the gestures are grander, with a wide-screen sonic sensibility that capitalised on Noel Gallagher's blossoming abilities as a songwriter, expanding into more intricate arrangements and surprisingly sensitive territory.

The melancholy Cast No Shadow features some of his most elegant and vulnerable lyrics, inspired by The Verve's Richard Ashcroft (who opened Oasis's comeback shows in the UK and Ireland) and riffing on chords from Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.

The cello-assisted yearning of Wonderwall and piano-led Don't Look Back In Anger possessed a timeless quality. Sure enough, 30 years on, they're both deathless hits.

Beyond the over-saturated singles, the rest of Morning Glory can still thrill.

The title track is a reminder that Oasis could rock — a maelstrom of wailing guitars signalled by a helicopter before Liam Gallagher's delivery of one of the great couplets about cocaine power fantasies ever penned:

Roll With It and the whimsical She's Electric are perfect examples of Beatles songs ""played with the attitude of The Rolling Stones and the volume of The Who,"" as ABC writer Matt Neal put it.

Meanwhile, The Jam frontman and Modfather himself, Paul Weller, played harmonica on the stormy Swamp Song instrumental interludes, and searing guitar histrionics on the epic curtain-closer Champagne Supernova.

""Thank God he did,"" Noel Gallagher reflected. ""It was crying out for a guitar solo because mine was a shocker.""

He had held a similarly self-deprecating streak towards his songwriting abilities.

""Everything that I do is a nod to something or other. I'm not a genius. I'm a fan of music. Paul McCartney's a genius, and Morrissey and Bob Dylan. I'm just fans of theirs.

That self-awareness belies Gallagher's talent for siphoning decades of British rock fanaticism — from The Kinks through to The Smiths and The Stone Roses — into a proverbial sonic trifle that was at once familiar but boasted a distinctive flavour.

Sibling chemistry

Responding to his elder brother's growth, Liam Gallagher upped the ante on his already commanding vocal sneer.

His instantly recognisable mix of unimpeachable bravado, charisma and yearning resulted in some of the most memorable rock vocal performances of his, or anyone's career.

Especially on Wonderwall, its name taken from a lesser-known George Harrison album and originally dedicated to Noel's ex-wife, Meg Matthews.

Who else could bring such conviction and sense of drama to lyrics whose own author was quick to dismiss as meaningless?

""You know, people have said that to me down the years, 'What does 'slowly walking down the hall faster than a cannonball mean?'"" Noel Gallagher said in his Take 5 with Zan Rowe, illuminating an important comparison between Champagne Supernova and I Am The Walrus by The Beatles.

""I'm like 'take enough drugs you'll know what it means'. Sitting on a cornflake? Yeah, I've sat on many a cornflake.""

Beyond the hedonism, Gallagher's songwriting is less about meaning than it is about mood and magnetic simplicity.

Don't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova — these songs feel pregnant with importance, even if ultimately, they're apocryphal.

They gesture at something thoughtful without being profound, which, for better or worse, has proven to resonate with a broad audience.

Just ask the band's resident 'man on the street', Liam Gallagher: the boorish, extroverted yin to Noel's relatively understated yang.

Despite their in-fighting, he clearly relished his elder brother's bar stool philosophy and bulletproof melodies that played to his strength as a vocalist.

Recording a classic

Having already recorded and released Some Might Say in April 1995 (which topped the charts months before the 'Battle of Britpop'), in May, Oasis decamped to Rockfield Studios, a former dairy farm situated in the Welsh countryside of Monmouth.

They were booked in for six weeks but ended up finishing the album in less than half that time.

""We worked hard. I think it was 12 business days,"" Noel Gallagher remembers.

He'd been boasting to journos as early as Definitely Maybe's release that he'd already written songs for a follow-up. In truth, there was the makings of half an album.

""Half the songs have got a second verse — they were all written before I got [there]. And the rest of the songs, it's just the first verse twice,"" he recalls. ""That was me getting in here and going 'oh well, f*** it'.

""You're just working on instinct because you don't second-guess anything when you're young.""

That sense of vigour and audacious machismo was all over the album, which reunited the band with producer Owen Morris.

""In the first five days we'd recorded Roll With It, Hello, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Champagne Supernova,"" he told Q Magazine in 2011.

The most productive week in Britpop history?

A feat made more remarkable considering the band hit the decks only a week after recruiting drummer Alan White (replacing Tony McCarroll), who swiftly found his place in the group dynamic.

""I soon cottoned on,"" White told Q Magazine. ""I was the Cockney c**t and they were the Manc f***ers. As a kind of family unit, it felt really good.""

The same can't be said for the Gallaghers, whose infamous sibling rivalry inevitably reared its head and temporarily brought sessions to a grinding halt.

Whereas Noel was laser-focused on overcoming difficult second album syndrome, staying up late working on mixes, and nailing the perfect take, Liam would quickly hammer out his vocal takes and become bored.

""There was loads of pubs in town that we'd heard were good,"" he said in a 2020 Rockfield documentary.

The night that nearly broke Oasis

After one particularly heavy drinking excursion, Liam invited a 20-strong entourage — ""a load of f***ing idiots back from the local village,"" according to Noel — for a party back at the studio's on-site accommodation.

That included members of British grunge band Cable, who began winding Liam up. Things turned sour, and drunken fisticuffs ensued, which only escalated once Noel returned from recording to the scene.

Liam remembers his brother's fury: ""'What you doing bringing people back when we're working?!' And I get it but …

""My argument would be: What are you doing f***ing taking 900 f***ing takes to f***ing do one guitar when you should be in the f***ing pub with me? You know what I mean? Entertaining me?""

The ensuing brawl involved air rifles, a cricket bat, a tossed rubbish bin, £800 in property damage, and Liam shouting obscenities after Noel as White drove him back to London.

The future of the band, let alone the album, was uncertain.

""Me and our kid [Noel] had a bit of a scuffle,"" Gallagher junior told Q Magazine in 2011.

The brothers didn't show up at the studio the following week.

""People felt they might not finish the album, for sure,"" Oasis photographer Michael Spencer Jones told BBC. ""It was a serious falling out … on another level.""

It's widely regarded as one of the worst conflicts in a very long list of volcanic Gallagher clashes. 

But that same tension is deeply intertwined with what many consider Oasis's finest musical hour, a toxic chemistry that's, weirdly, also a winning formula.

After almost 10 days, and some delicate behind-the-scenes diplomacy, the Gallaghers decided not to look back in anger.

The band reconvened at Rockfield and finished off recording She's Electric, Cast No Shadow, Hey Now, and Morning Glory.

""That second session was the best, easiest, least fraught, most happily creative time I've ever had in a recording studio,"" Morris recalled.

Oasis ended up having songs to spare, recording several B-sides that — in Noel Gallagher's own estimation — were ""good enough to launch any band's career.""

Acquiesce, Talk Tonight, Headshrinker, Rockin' Chair, Underneath The Sky, and The Masterplan: all fan favourites that featured on a compilation, also titled The Masterplan, that many consider ranks alongside the first two studio albums as Oasis's best work.

In retrospect, Gallagher believes it was his most fruitful creative period.

""The Masterplan' might've been the last of the f***in' great culturally significant songs that I wrote,"" he said in 2020.

Live forever

In 1996, Oasis headlined two historic concerts at Knebworth, England, to more than 250,000 fans — some of the biggest concerts in British history.

Be Here Now, the band's third album, was released in August 1997 to rave reviews (from critics who'd learned to save face after slagging off its predecessor). It became Britain's fastest-selling album ever, but swiftly denounced as a disappointment.

The long, indulgent ""sound of five men in the studio, on coke, not giving a f***,"" as Noel Gallagher put it in the 2003 Britpop documentary Live Forever.

Liam, on the other hand, thought ""it was f***ing great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory.""

Indeed. Be Here Now was considered rock-bottom because Morning Glory is credited as being Britpop's pinnacle, the barometer by which Oasis was subsequently measured.

Their 2000s records contained flashes of brilliance but began to sound tired, bloated, and struggling to reach the rarefied heights of their earlier output.

Oasis always acted as if they were invincible, but (What's The Story) Morning Glory? marked the point they were legitimately unstoppable.

Now, 30 years later, Oasis is enjoying the fairytale rock narrative the Fab Four never got to: the reunion.

As polarising as the Gallaghers and their graceless public personas could be, the music they made as Oasis possessed a magnetism that brought audiences together.

Just ask the social media users sharing in the opposite of Schadenfreude in seeing the long-feuding Gallaghers seemingly enjoying each other's company on stage again.

Witness the crowds of people singing along word for passionate word. And it isn't just aging Millennials in football jerseys and bucket hats but younger fans belting out classics that have outlived their '90s origins.

Is this collective evidence that Oasis really is the long-touted 'People's Band' after all? Not maybe. Definitely.

""The people that made [the greatest] records, they're not making them for journalists,"" Noel Gallagher remarked around Morning Glory's 25th anniversary.

""They're making them for the people, and the people decide what's hot [and] what is not. And that's it, the end.""

ACT police said the man from Ngunnawal was struck by the vehicle at the intersection of Northbourne Avenue and the Barton Highway in Downer on Saturday night.

Emergency services were called about 7:15pm and treated the man at the scene before he was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Police said he died a short time later.

It is the ACT's first fatality related to a light rail vehicle since the line began operating in 2019.

364078654,Snow town struggles as high housing prices force residents out,"Charlie Steinbacher knows how his town changes in winter, when crowds of avid snow goers flock to the ski slopes.

""Winter versus summer is like chalk and cheese,"" the born-and-raised Jindabyne resident said.

Jindabyne is the base town of the New South Wales ski resorts.

It has a population of about 4,000 people but explodes with tourists during winter.

More than 380,000 people travelled to the Snowy Mountains region between July and September in 2024 alone, according to Destination NSW.

About one-quarter of Jindabyne's 2,900 homes are short-term rental accommodation.

Mr Steinbacher, who runs an indoor rock-climbing business in Jindabyne, said he had been priced out of town.

""Everyone would love to own a home in Jindabyne where we all grew up, but it's just not really viable,"" he said.

Locals priced out

Mr Steinbacher moved to Berridale, 30 minutes away, last year, joining a cohort of young locals.

The average house in Jindabyne is on the market for more than $1.1 million and median unit rents have increased by nearly 85 per cent in the past five years.

The median house price has increased by $300,000 since 2020 and is now double that of 15 years ago, according to housing data analysts Cotality.

Unit prices have nearly tripled since 2010.

Nancy Gant-Thompson owns her home but hosts a ski instructor as a boarder each winter to afford heating.

""It's either a choice of downsizing … or sharing your accommodation and your home with people.""

Ms Gant-Thompson said she knew of many older people who moved to Canberra because of Jindabyne's high prices.

It is a regular source of conversation at Country Women's Association meetings.

""There's not a lot of places available for rent,"" member Dale Whitfield said.

The NSW government announced in 2019 that it would create the Snowy Mountains Special Activation Precinct, a 40-year plan to grow year-round tourism and housing stock in the region.

The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development told the ABC the government acquired land in Jindabyne near the Southern Connector Road corridor in 2024 that could ""offer an additional 500 dwellings"" over the next 20 years.

It said the ""masterplan"" for the future of Jindabyne would aim ""to increase the variety of housing available"" and improve supply and affordability.

Short-term rental review

The state government is reviewing short-term rental accommodation.

Snowy Monaro Regional Council made a submission to the review, raising concerns about the impacts of short-term rentals on housing affordability but noting tourism benefits.

""It is essential for the continued growth and vitality of the town that Jindabyne continues to provide tourist accommodation,"" the council submission read.

The government said it was investigating the submissions ahead of proposing sector reforms.

It comes a year after it implemented a 60-day cap on short-term rentals in Byron Bay to increase the supply of long-term rentals.

Property manager and real estate agent Joan Bird said she did not think the cap system would work in Jindabyne, as owners used the properties as holiday homes themselves.

""They want to be able to use those properties themselves, be it summer or winter, and the way to help up-front those costs is on short-term rentals,"" she said.

'Location, location, location''

Ms Bird called on the nearby snow resorts to develop more worker accommodation to alleviate pressure on the rental market.

The resorts combined bring in thousands of workers each winter season, many of whom stay in Jindabyne.

Thredbo Resort told the ABC it hired 900 seasonal staff for the winter period and leased 270 beds in Jindabyne ""which are sourced both privately and through local real estate agencies"".

It purchased a property within the resort to expand staff housing in 2023, adding 60 beds to its stock.

Perisher said it offered staff accommodation on the mountain, at dedicated staff accommodation in Jindabyne, and ""in limited volumes of private accommodation"" in the region.

The company did not disclose specific staffing or property details or figures.

364074684,Aussie star has no interest in being one of the greats,"In 2023, Sam Retford was renewing his passport with plans to return to Australia, where he would buy a ute and start an underwater film-making company.

After nine years in the acting industry, the then 24-year-old felt he was no longer the person to tell any of the stories that were coming to him.

""I'd get a piece through and I'd be like, 'so and so would be fantastic at doing that. I don't know why they're giving it to me',"" the Australian-born actor tells AAP.

""Even for the jobs that I got.""

So he decided to retire.

For many actors, self-doubt is a familiar feeling throughout their careers.

Take Tom Hanks, who admitted his belief people were going to discover he ""was a fraud"", or Kate Winslet, who was afraid of people thinking they had ""cast the wrong person"".

But a last-minute call from his agent pleading for a final audition for the prequel to hit historical fantasy series Outlander marked a ""sliding doors"" moment for the young actor.

""This came through; I remember reading that and going, 'I can f***ing tell that story',"" he says.

Fast-forward two years, Retford is starring in a leading role as Dougal MacKenzie in Blood of my Blood, chronicling the romantic saga surrounding the parents of the main series protagonists.

It's a day off for the 26-year-old, who's based in Glasgow shooting the already greenlit second season, but Retford plans on spending it practising stunts in the garden.

Several weeks earlier, the cast had been in Hollywood for the series premiere.

""We got off the plane in Los Angeles at the airport and there's all these people with posters. You've got billboards, and everyone's screaming. We're on some trams in Sydney,"" he says.

Retford's on-screen persona, Dougal MacKenzie, whom he views as a ""revolutionary"", is a brutish warrior and, at times, reckless when it comes to the family name.

But don't ask about comparisons between him and the character he has lived and breathed for two years.

""You have to be completely on board with all of your character's decisions,"" he says.

While many who have watched the series have heaped praise on the cast, Retford admits he steers clear of his own performances.

""Either you watch it and you're like, 'oh, that was really good', which I never think, or you watch it and you just slate yourself, and that also isn't good,"" he says.

""At the end of the day, it's creativity. I'm not in this to be the best actor on the planet, because I know I'm not, and I've no interest in being one of the greats.""

In Retford's eyes, there are two sides to the industry: the ""athletes"", who study the craft and push acting as far as it can go, and there's the other side.

""We are entertainers and jesters, in a way still storytellers, and we're here to give people an hour a week of disconnect from whatever's going on in their life,"" he says.

Born in Gosford, on NSW's Central Coast, he grew up along a dirt track speckled with a couple of houses surrounded by dense eucalyptus.

As a teen, the family moved to England, and his need to become a ""chameleon"" to fit in was when he got his first taste of acting.

Retford credits his diving instructor mum for his love of nature and travel and also his most unconditional supporter.

It's something Retford has taken with him through life as he travels the world, riding motorbikes, diving, caving and camping in the wild.

But don't mistake him for an adrenaline junkie.

""All of the sports I pursue are all ultra-mindful. You can only think about the thing you're doing whilst you're doing it.""

He admits Australia is a place he'd like to do a pilgrimage back to, but that will have to wait as he faces a second season in the Scottish highlands.","Outlander: Blood of my Blood star Sam Retford delves into the moment that nearly led him to quit acting, and how he is not interested in being the best.",https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/aussie-star-has-no-interest-in-being-one-of-the-greats-c-20165815,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20165815/e75e07c1c616a106f9cac4d7ea4a92f77673be93-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-09-27 22:31:55,"William Ton,William Tonaapsun","['William Ton', 'William Tonaapsun']",en,,au,0.038
364078658,A daffodil cross that 'wasn't meant to be achieved' made Rod Barwick famous,"Growing up in Hobart's northern outskirts, Rod Barwick felt he did not fit in with his own family.

""I was not the person that my family would have dreamed of. I was not the person that many of the local community would have expected,"" Mr Barwick said.

""I realised that I would probably need to find another life for myself.""

That life soon became one of daffodils, a passion that has never left him.

As a 19-year-old, Mr Barwick was working in an office at the then-Electrolytic Zinc Company (EZ) in Lutana.

""From a garden magazine, at the beginning of 1972, I bought some collections of daffodils — that is now 54 years ago — and those bulbs grew well for me.""

Daffodil crosses named after detectives

Three years after buying his first bulbs, Mr Barwick started reading about plants and plant breeding.

""I actually did a cross that wasn't meant to be able to be achieved in daffodil breeding — I crossed a winter flowering white hoop petticoat with a spring flowering yellow hoop petticoat,"" he said.

""Because the cross wasn't meant to be achieved … I thought I was a bit of a botanical detective, so I used detective names for the flowers that I raised and I named them 'Smarple' as in Miss Marple and 'Spoirot' as in Hercule Poirot, et cetera.

""And they have gone on to achieve international recognition with Dutch nurseries propagating them in huge scale.""

There are 36 species of daffodil, and more than 26,000 cultivated varieties, according to the the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

'An artist with the pollen brush'

Cultivars from Mr Barwick's Glenbrook Bulb Farm have consistently won prizes at local, interstate and international flower shows.

Mr Barwick has been showing flowers for the past 50 years.

In 1985, he and his sister Anne started a spring flower show at Claremont in Hobart's northern suburbs.

This year the show celebrated its 40th anniversary.

One of the judges was Richard Perrignon, an Australian member of the Bulb Expert Group of the Royal Horticultural Society in London.

Mr Perrignon described Mr Barwick as ""an artist with the pollen brush"".

""And he's very ambitious in his art,"" he said.

""What he is famous for is miniature daffodils, and he was one of the first in Australia to realise how valuable they were.""

Mr Perrignon said while standard daffodils have been bred in England and in Australia since the 19th century, it was not until after World War II that people started to become aware of 'species daffodils'.

""[Species daffodils] are tiny little things like the hoop petticoat daffodils and one we can narcissus cyclamineus,"" he said.

""In England it was Alec Gray who first really bred with them.

""It was Rod who introduced that interest to Australia … in the 70s and 80s, and really he has done at least as well as Alec Gray ever did for Britain and Europe — so he's a very important man in the daffodil world.""

In 2023, Mr Barwick was the recipient of the Peter Barr Memorial Cup, presented by the Royal Horitcultural Society, for his breeding work in daffodils.

""Rod is one of only four Australians ever to have been awarded that,"" Mr Perrignon said.

Next generation learning to love flowers

Throughout his career Mr Barwick has been encouraging others to enjoy growing and showing their flowers, including his niece, Janelle Noble.

""I would see a lot of his seedlings come up and be inspired in the way that I wanted to do my own … and he would encourage me in the way that he would give me the right advice on what I could cross with what and how to enhance the best attributes of a flower,"" Ms Noble said.

She also shares Mr Barwick's love of miniature daffodils.

""They're truly enchanting,"" she said.

For many years, Mr Barwick sold bulbs via catalogues to growers and gardeners around the country. The catalogues featured his drawings and snippets of life at Glenbrook.

In his 25th annual catalogue, which was for the 2004-05 season, he wrote:

""Looking back, it seems remarkable to me that I have been able to live the last quarter of a century always working here on the property that was home to my parents and grandparents before — making a living by growing bulbs, plants and flowers and surrounded by birds, animals and the hills of Claremont … I guess I must be one of the luckiest people in the world!""

He went on to describe himself as living ""pretty much the life of an eccentric, aging would-be recluse"".

Despite his many successes, Mr Barwick said the most important thing was to enjoy growing.

""In the culture in which I was brought up, winning was terribly important — to be a success, to be a winner, whatever.","Rod Barwick planted his first daffodil bulbs in the 1970s. Within a few years he was breeding daffodils and has been recognised internationally for his work, but he says enjoying growing plants is the most important part of gardening.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/rod-barwick-daffodil-breeder-glenbrook-bulb-farm/105803774,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3907ef6e084b6a4cf6ef398858e6be28?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2956&cropW=5256&xPos=13&yPos=837&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 22:21:19,Loretta Lohberger,['Loretta Lohberger'],en,entertainment,AU,0.351
364078660,"Feral pigs found in SA were imported illegally from NSW, testing shows","Feral pigs found and destroyed on South Australia's Limestone Coast were illegally brought into the region from New South Wales, DNA testing has found.

The Limestone Coast Landscape Board (LCLB) said three attempts had been made to introduce a pig population in the region at Kingston SE, Robe and Mount Burr in the past three to four years.

Operations manager Mike Stevens said the board worked quickly to ensure the pigs did not become established.

""It's likely people have gone up there, caught some pigs, presumably brought them back home and released them on purpose to establish a hunting population for themselves,"" he said.

""There's been some work done that's confirmed the genetics of the animals being released are from southern NSW.""

Mr Stevens said feral pigs could reproduce rapidly.

""In optimal conditions a pregnant female can have up to 10 kids [that are] sexually mature within six months [after a] a three- to four-month gestation period.

""If you do the maths … basically one pregnant female can result in 200 to 300 kids within two years.

""Through a combination of trapping, poison baiting, visual aerial shooting and thermal-assisted aerial shooting, we've removed close to 90 animals in one location.

""That was within the space of 12 months.""

The LCLB was aware of one pig remaining in the region, he said.

'Mini bulldozers'

Invasive Species Council chief executive Jack Gough said feral pigs were ""mini bulldozers"".

""If the farmers of north-west NSW or south-west Queensland could go back in time and not have feral pigs, I'm pretty sure they would spend whatever they could to make sure they don't,"" he said.

""[That's] because of the scale of destruction that they cause in the landscape and the speed at which they populate … and the speed with which they spread.""

Mr Gough said 85 per cent of a feral pig population needed to be removed annually to ensure the population did not grow.

""A population of about 100 pigs, in good circumstances without control, can get to about 30,000 within a decade,"" he said.

Mr Stevens said feral pigs cost Australia more than $150 million per year and that there were maximum penalties of a $125,000 fine or two years' imprisonment for their illegal release.

Ears removed from some pigs

Mr Stevens said some pregnant female pigs in south-west Victoria had had their ears cut off, which made it harder for pig dogs to capture them.

""It's a technique that's known that if you're trying to establish animals, remove the ears, which means it's less likely for them to be caught,"" he said.

""The feedback we've had from some landholders across the border is that we've got feral pigs within about 18 kilometres of the South Australian border.

The control efforts on the Limestone Coast are working so far but Mr Gough said there was anecdotal evidence pigs had travelled from eastern states and established themselves in the Flinders Ranges.

""If they are establishing in the Flinders Ranges through drought conditions, that means that in good seasons they will start to push further south.

""We could start to get pig populations down to Port Augusta, then into the Adelaide Hills, then further down south.""

Mr Stevens encouraged any landholder who spotted signs of feral pigs to contact the LCLB.","Dozens of pigs were released illegally over several attempts to establish populations for hunting, with a local landscape board warning of the danger a feral population could cause.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/dna-testing-finds-feral-pigs-illegally-brought-into-sa-from-nsw/105806616,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/69f674dd02f526b8955fb2e18b8003d4?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=674&cropW=1199&xPos=44&yPos=160&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 22:20:08,Josh Brine,['Josh Brine'],en,,AU,-0.135
364074692,Seed oils: Making sense of the complex science behind good cooking oils,"We all consume them. Oils are an inescapable element of the modern western diet.

Yet the matter of which food oils are best for our health is complex, confusing and, at times, controversial.

Canola, safflower, coconut, peanut, avocado, olive, rice bran and grapeseed are some of the many available oils on supermarket shelves.

The increasingly long list has been driven by the rise and proliferation of seed oils.

They are cheap to produce on an industrial scale and come with a long shelf life, making them a common ingredient in ultra processed foods.

Seed oils were initially marketed as “heart-healthy” alternatives to saturated fats, with clinical trials showing people who replaced saturated fats with them had lower cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk.

But there are growing concerns that excessive levels of linoleic acid, which is an omega 6 polyunsaturated fat and can be found in high proportions in some seed oils, can have adverse health effects, causing inflammation and chronic diseases.

Charlotte Rowley, a Perth dietitian who studied oils for four years as part of her PhD, said the question of the healthiest oil was the one she was asked most.

“People are confused about many aspects of nutrition, because there is always new information coming out which can sometimes seem conflicting, particularly the way some things are marketed,” she said.

“With regards to oils specifically, perhaps part of the reason is because people do use them so regularly, and it is a pretty easy swap to make to have a positive impact on your health.”

People’s consumption of seed oils has skyrocketed in recent years, driven by the huge increase in ultra processed foods as a proportion of the modern western diet.

This is thought to have led to excessive levels of linoleic acid in many people’s bodies, which can lead to an imbalance in essential fatty acids.

Dr Rowley, also a dietitian and educator for Diabetes WA, said seed oils tend to be higher in linoleic acid, an omega 6 essential fatty acid that the body cannot make itself and which has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

However, linoleic acid can break down into arachidonic acid — another fatty acid important for our cell membranes and signalling, but has also been associated with inflammation, she added.

Raysa El Zein, a public health nutritionist from the University of Westminster, said a healthy diet should have a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids of 4:1, but people have recently been consuming much more omega-6 than omega-3, with a ratio of 15:1 in some cases.

“So if you’re looking for a healthier ratio, eat more foods rich in omega-3, such as seafood, avocado and nuts. Some oils, such as olive oil, are also rich in omega-3,” Dr El Zein wrote in The Conversation last year.

“As long as people consume enough omega-3, the consumption of omega-6 would not cause inflammation. In fact, their combined intake would reduce the risk of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes.”

But in Australia, almost half of adults’, and 55 per cent of children’s, energy intake is made up of UPFs, which means many people are probably not getting enough omega-3 fatty acids.

Seed oils have been branded toxic by some, perhaps partly because of the processing used to extract the oil using high heat and pressure and chemical solvents.

Dr Rowley said it was unreasonable to group all seed oils as the same.

“Often the statistics around oil use are linked with ultra processed foods (like chips or fried foods). We know these foods are not good for us but we can’t assign the blame solely to the type of oil they are cooked with,” she said.

“These foods are also high in salt, sugar, additives or other components that might contribute to inflammation. The whole “food matrix” is likely to be more important that one single ingredient.

“Therefore, some people are reducing these ultra processed foods, but assigning any health benefits primarily to the oil.”

The findings of research into seed oils and linoleic oil consumption are mixed.

Earlier this year, a study of 81 people with colorectal cancer found their tumours had high levels of bioactive lipids, produced when the body breaks down linoleic acid into arachidonic acid.

The researchers from the University of South Florida said the western diet, low in fibre and rich in omega 6 fatty acids such as linolenic acid, was “strongly linked” to chronic inflammation and colorectal cancer development and progression, while the omega 3 rich diet was proposed to have the opposite effect.

“We hypothesise that CRC (colorectal cancer) may be driven by the imbalance of pro-inflammatory>pro-resolving lipid mediators, resulting in chronic inflammation, tumour growth and progression,” they wrote.

Cases of early onset colorectal, or bowel, cancer in people under 50 have been rising by eight per cent a year with Australians born in the 1990s up to three times as likely to get the disease than those born in 1950s, a University of Melbourne study found earlier this year.

Scientists believe lifestyle diet changes in the younger generation, and the negative impact on the gut microbiome, could be behind the worrying trend.

But, in June this year, a new US study analysed blood markers from almost 1900 people and found higher levels of linoleic acid were linked to lower inflammation and better cardiometabolic health.

Dr Rowley said it was likely that the research picture on oils was so mixed was because it has been over-simplifying human physiology.

“If we look at the technology we have now to assess individual metabolomes, we can see that people don’t respond the same way to the same food. We tested this as part of my PhD, where a few of us ate the same food, and examined our urine samples afterwards – the results are significantly different,” she said.

“So, the likely reason we have so much conflicting evidence in nutrition in general is because we need to start examining and interpreting the metabolic response on a more individual level.”

The current Australian Dietary Guidelines, set in 2013, recommend replacing food high in saturated fats, such as butter, cooking margarine, coconut and palm oil, with foods that contain predominantly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, such as vegetable or seed oils.

“The link between dietary saturated fat, serum cholesterol and cardiovascular disease is well established,” they state. “Replacing dietary saturated fat with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is associated with improved blood lipid profiles and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.”

Dr Rowley said a recent review of the research she conducted found that saturated fats, with the exception of butter, were not as bad for us as previously thought.

“But I wouldn’t be recommending any of my patients go home and start using tallow,” she added.

Australian of the Year in 2020, James Muecke, an ophthalmologist turned public health advocate, has warned that seed oils — rich in inflammatory omega 6 fatty acids — can cause insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction if consumed in excess.

“Avoid eating food cooked in these polyunsaturated oils (especially deep fried and fast foods) and avoid eating baked and processed products that contain them. Instead, use natural saturated fats such as butter, lard or ghee,” he wrote on social media in January 2022.

Dr Muecke called for Australia’s dietary guidelines, which are currently under review with new guidelines to be published next year, to stop recommending seed oil consumption.

“The dramatic rise in PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) and LA (linoleic acid) consumption has coincided with the rapid rise in chronic metabolic disease including obesity and type 2 diabetes,” he wrote a submission to the parliamentary review.

“The primary concerns about omega-6 PUFAs such as LA are that they are present in historically unprecedented levels in Western diets, and they oxidise readily into toxic metabolites known as oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs).

“Humans evolved consuming low levels of omega-6 fatty acids, in an approximate ratio of 1:1 with omega-3 fatty acids. The ratio is now estimated at 20:1 or greater.”

Dr Rowley said she recommended cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) because it is the least processed and her research had shown it did not deteriorate when heated.

“Olive is a high oleic acid oil, and oleic acid is actually approved by the US FDA for the nutrition claims of reducing coronary heart disease, indicating that there is significant evidence to support this,” she said.

“EVOO are also particularly high in polyphenols, and while we are still understanding these compounds, there is research to suggest they can act as potent antioxidants, further supporting heart health.”

Dr Rowley said given the high price of EVOO, her preferred alternatives were high-oleic safflower and canola oils.

While the oil debate will continue, a good way to avoid the harms of excessive linoleic acid is to stop eating ultra processed foods.

“If we could get people to eat less processed foods and more vegetables, then we wouldn’t necessarily have to be so specific about the oil,” Dr Rowley said.","We all consume them.

While the selection focus centred on whether Brownlow Medallist Lachie Neale would be able to perform in the grand final — and boy, what a performance his was — less considered was the fact that Dunkley was carrying an injury himself.
After the Lions defeat of Collingwood last Saturday, Dunkley left Melbourne wearing a moon boot to protect an ankle that will require surgery, he revealed amid the bedlam in the Brisbane rooms on Saturday night.

Despite carrying a Grade 3 syndesmosis injury into the grand final, the Lion was able to gather 16 disposals and lay five tackles in a brave performance. But this Brisbane campaign has been built on self-belief and he was confident he could deliver.
“Fages brought that up a couple of weeks ago, and it has lived on, and I am sure it is going to be brought up again when we have a meeting soon,” he said. 
But that surgery can wait, not just because of the celebrations that will continue to the Brunswick St Oval in Fitzroy on Sunday and then at Brighton Homes Arena in Springfield later in the evening.
Before the ankle is operated on, the 28-year-old will undergo another on the left shoulder that has troubled him for a while, with that to be carried out on Tuesday. 

Just so anyone reading this is aware, Dunkley was at pains to insist the injuries were not a big deal and that the focus should be on the broader Brisbane effort, which was brilliant as they defeated Geelong by 47 points.

There will be barrels of ink spilt on his champion team and his teammates, so it does no disservice to touch on the bravery of the hardened midfielder either. Dunkley was always willing to pay the price stemming from playing in the decider.
“We’ve got ten weeks not to get better in the off-season and I’ll do anything for this club, because they have given me this opportunity,” he said.
“(It didn’t) feel great. Not great at all. I might be sitting down later but it is worth every bit of pain that I went through.”

'I want to be just like you!' 

A cute moment with Cam Rayner followed the AFL Grand...

Dunkley, who has had a significant impact with the Lions since moving north, said he underwent a scan last Sunday and was advised by the medical staff that while he would require surgery, they would be able to make sure he played the grand final.
“(The doctor) said to me, ‘You are not going to miss. We will get you up for it,’” he said.
“I have to get another couple of surgeries now, but that is part of being an AFL player. You put up with the adversity, but I don’t want this to be about me. I want this to be about the group. The group has overcome adversity all year, and for younger guys to come in and play their role is so special, so special.”
In terms of the severity of the ankle injury, he said it was “up there”. The shoulder he is having surgery on requires a reconstruction.

“Nothing beats the shoulders, to be honest, but the ankle, playing with this was pretty painful,” he said.
“I can do them both at the same time. It will be the shoulder first and then the ankle after that, because I can walk a little bit. I am sure it will be pretty sore tomorrow, but I’ll be fine.”

364068398,‘Shut the f*** up’: McIlroy blows up as Ryder Cup mayhem causes concern,"Golf commentators have been genuinely stunned at ugly scenes that have unfolded with added security needed to protect the Northern Irishman from rowdy spectators. 

McIlroy angrily told one group of spectators to “shut the f*** up” after he was repeatedly heckled during Sunday’s action at the famous Bethpage Black course on Long Island, New York.

There have been reports that heckling from some spectators turned disgusting with some commentators reporting McIlroy and Shane Lowry were both abused with comments made about their families. 

According to reports, Lowry asked for some fans to be evicted from the course before extra security was deployed to monitor rowdy galleries during the Europe star’s afternoon four-ball match as tensions reached fever pitch.

In his morning foursome match with Tommy Fleetwood, McIlroy — who on Friday had flipped the middle finger to hecklers — used an obscenity as he told noisy fans to “shut up” as he prepared to play a shot.

You can watch the incident in the video player above.

It had TV broadcasters apologising to viewers at home who heard the remark clearly through their TV speakers. 

Later, McIlroy was forced to pack off a putt by a heckler on the fourth hole in his four-ball match with pal Lowry, a move that draw of chorus of boos and prompted McIlroy to ask a rules official if anything could be done about over-the-top annoyers.

“I don’t mind them having a go at us,” McIlroy told reporters at his press conference after the match. 

“Like, that’s to be expected. That’s what an away Ryder Cup is. Whenever they are still doing it while you are over the ball and trying to hit your shot, that’s a tough thing.

“Look, in between shots, say whatever you want to me. That’s totally fine. But just let us — you gave us the respect to let us hit shots and give us the same chance that the Americans have, I guess.”

As Europe stretched its lead over the United States, McIlroy became the focus of most of the remarks and insults from the crowd, from the creative to the mundane.

“You really just have to focus on the task at hand,” McIlroy said, adding that mental toughness was a requirement.

Even after making an obscene gesture to the crowd on Friday, McIlroy said after Friday’s play that the spite being fired his way was “what we sort of expected.” “It was rowdy and lively,” McIlroy said. “They made it difficult for us, but I felt like Shane and I, we handled that really well and dug in. Made some good swings and good putts when we needed to.” McIlroy, who dropped to his knees and cried on the 18th green at Augusta after winning the Masters to complete a career Grand Slam, has fed off the intense atmosphere, saying on the eve of the event he has struggled to find a balance on how much to engage with hostile crowds.

“At times in the Ryder Cup, I’ve engaged too much with that, too much with the crowd,” McIlroy said.

“But then there’s times where I haven’t engaged enough. So it’s really just trying to find the balance of using that energy from the crowd to fuel your performance.”",Mayhem is unfolding at the Ryder Cup with Rory McIlroy losing the plot over disgusting crowd taunts with a security team needed to be deployed.,https://www.news.com.au/sport/golf/shut-the-f-up-mcilroy-blows-up-as-ryder-cup-mayhem-causes-concern/news-story/a9624b0dfb3ae620d444375595a93a5d?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b637d289cbf67b3dbca3b310699a96bb,,2025-09-27 22:14:17,Tyson Otto,['Tyson Otto'],en,,au,0.139
364078652,How Fagan avoided looking 'like a total idiot' with inspired Neale sub call,"Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan admits he took a punt by naming Lachie Neale as the sub ahead of their stunning win over Geelong in Saturday's grand final.

Neale thought his season was over after injuring his calf in the Lions' qualifying final loss to the Cats earlier this month.

But 22 days later, the two-time Brownlow medallist was holding a second premiership cup aloft with Lions co-captain Harris Andrews.

The 32-year-old had an instant impact when he was subbed into the match for teenager Sam Marshall at the start of the third quarter at the MCG.

Neale finished with 17 disposals, seven clearances and one famous goal in a second half that will go down in grand final folklore.

""I was lying in bed last night thinking, 'I'm either going to look like a total idiot or a total genius,'"" Fagan said after the Lions' 47-point win.

""If we had lost, and he'd (Neale) only played a half, we'd probably be bemoaning the fact we went about it that way.

""The bottom line was Lachie was fit to play. But how much game time could he play?

""Because basically, he'd played one game in 56 days, and coming into a grand final, I was a little bit worried about his ability to see the whole game out if he had to actually start.""

Neale said he was the ""most nervous"" he had ever been in his career before coming on for the Lions.

Having been the sub in Fremantle's 2013 grand final loss, Neale had not performed that role since round one in 2014.

""I haven't done it (play as a substitute) in about 11 years, so I was pretty nervous knowing I was coming on to be the sub in the third,"" Neale said.

""Probably the most nervous I've ever been just sitting there waiting and knowing if the game was in the balance, they were going to sub me on.""

The decision to play Neale, coming in for injured teammate Jarrod Berry, was deemed a major risk because his initial injury assessment had him sidelined for six weeks.

Neale was able to tell Fagan he was right to go at Thursday's main training session, but Berry selflessly made the call to pull out of contention for the grand final.

Neale himself had declared his season over on social media, but now conceded he ""looks like a goose"".

But the Lions and Neale were always adamant he would be fit to play, and he was confirmed as the surprise sub on Saturday.

He knew he was going to be right to go after a gruelling running session before the Lions' preliminary final against Collingwood.

""You hear a bit of the noise and question yourself, but I've got great people around me who told me to delete all the apps off my phone, which I did,"" Neale said.

""[I decided to] Listen to those close to me and block out the outside noise.

""I was confident in the calf, it was more about if I could run out the game, full stop.

""It's a bit of a master stroke, it looks good now. I'm glad I made a bit of an impact.""",Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan admits he took a punt by naming Lachie Neale as the sub ahead of their stunning win over Geelong in the grand final.,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/afl-grand-final-brisbane-lions-chris-fagan-lachie-neale/105825616,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9975495ada1145d32d8ca21cff89b56c?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2387&cropW=4244&xPos=0&yPos=143&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 22:04:16,ABC News,['ABC News'],en,,AU,-0.225
364074686,"'Not the cow, the how': calls to overhaul food system","Across the rolling plains on Randal Breen's farm, thousands of chooks follow the path of gently grazing cattle.

As the herd moves around the property in Queensland's Goomburra Valley, the hens trail behind in large enclosures, scratching at the dirt, spreading cow pats and dropping their own manure.

""They've become our sanitation and fertilisation program,"" Mr Breen tells AAP of his flock of 3500 chickens.

""We're using livestock as a tool to heal the landscape rather than extract from it.""

Echo Valley Farm is a regenerative agriculture operation where livestock is strategically moved to help pastures recover between periods of grazing in an effort to preserve the land and boost soil nutrients.

With the help of the chickens, Mr Breen and his wife Juanita can avoid using synthetic fertilisers.

""The poor old cow gets denigrated for its contribution to climate change but we use the term 'it's not the cow, it's the how',"" Mr Breen says.

Rather than thinking of their produce as a commodity, the Breens say they are committed to caring for the land, their animals, producing nutrient-rich food and earning a stable income.

They run a subscription service that delivers boxes of their beef and eggs to members, based on the understanding production varies with seasonal conditions.

It puts community at the centre of food and gives consumers insight into the ebb and flow of farming, Mr Breen says.

""When you set productivity as the driver, the environment, people, community and animals all suffer,"" he says.

""But when we prioritise those things, productivity is the end result.""

Productivity and economic growth have been listed as key priorities in the federal government's discussion paper for a food security strategy, aiming to ensure Australians always have access to sufficient and nutritious food.

That's left regenerative farmers like Mr Breen, some scientists and conservationists concerned Australia's first national strategy will put economics before the environment, public health and welfare.

The National Farmers' Federation welcomes Agriculture Minister Julie Collins' commitment to a strategy, recognising it would take a wide view of the food system.

President David Jochinke argues productivity, supply chains and access to imported farm inputs should be at the heart of any future policy.

""Australian agriculture has the potential to be a $100 billion industry by 2030 but we need secure supply chains and strategic investment to get there,"" he said in August.

But others believe the tendency to focus on the value and volume of agricultural production ignores the greater complexities of the food system.

Health, nutrition, climate change and nature are considered ""whole of system considerations"" in the government's paper, rather than central tenets.

Public health nutritionist Katherine Kent says it's people who should be at the heart of food policy, particularly when 1.3 million Australians experienced food insecurity in 2023.

Food insecurity is defined as anxiety about not having enough money for groceries, the inability to access healthy options or having to skip meals or go hungry due to socio-economic pressures.

People living in remote areas, single-parent households and older Australians are more vulnerable to food insecurity, the 2023 data shows.

That, in turn, leads to a greater burden of mental health issues, isolation and chronic health conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers, says Dr Kent, a senior lecturer at the University of Wollongong.

""We have a problem with the social determinants of health in this country, so the people who are most disadvantaged are experiencing the worst health outcomes,"" she says.

""Food insecurity is not about food production, it's about the economic access to food and the social barriers that stop people from putting enough healthy food on the table.""

While the government's paper recognises all people are entitled to food security and looks beyond the scope of agriculture, Dr Kent says framing it around productivity risks public health.

""The government needs to start to take this seriously so that people have the choice and the agency ... in making healthy food choices,"" she says.

Public health experts argue the food system could be bolstered by continued monitoring of insecurity, rolling out school lunch programs and greater support for co-operatives that give consumers an alternative to the major supermarkets.

A CSIRO report on the state of Australia's food system also warned that emphasising economic gains has ""crowded out"" the pursuit of sustainability, equity, food safety and health goals.

By instead putting public health and the environment at the centre of food security, productivity would naturally follow, the Australian Conservation Foundation's nature and business lead Nathaniel Pelle says.

""Productivity and economic growth should ... only be priorities to the extent that they support the real goal, which is giving people enough food,"" Mr Pelle tells AAP.

""But if they are achieved by destroying the nature or natural capital that the food industry requires, then from a long-term point-of-view, that leads to future losses of productivity.

""That also means we can't produce enough food for future generations.""

Launching the Feeding Australia discussion paper, minister Collins said the government had listened to farmers and the community.

""Ensuring we get the priorities of Feeding Australia right is incredibly important, which is why I encourage our farmers, producers, regional communities and other stakeholders in the food supply chain to provide their input,"" she said.

364074688,Dami Im: Aussie singer return returning to Telethon as a mother with renewed appreciation for fundraiser,"Aussie singer-songwriter Dami Im has performed at Telethon several times before, but as the mother’s young family continues to expand, so too has her empathy for those involved in the fundraising weekend.

Now 36, Im returns as a headline act as a mother of two, with new son Rory joining the family in June, with husband Noah Kim and elder son Harry, 3.

She admitted it was impossible to understand the pain and anguish of a parent whose children are unwell — until having her own.

“There’s nothing worse than imagining your child to be sick, even just being sick with a cold, it’s horrifying, let alone all the different types of illnesses that these children in hospital are facing,” she told The Sunday Times.

“So it does mean so much more being part of this. It feels a lot more personal.”

Claiming Australia’s The X Factor crown in 2013, and placing a national-high second at Eurovision in 2016, the singer will have no issues winning over an RAC Arena crowd of kids and parents if they’re as passionate as her own children.

Or at least her toddler Harry, who is his mother’s number one fan despite being unaware of her credentials.

“He loves watching his mum perform, I feel very narcissistic. He just wants to listen to my music, and I swear I didn’t force it upon him but he just wants to watch me sing,” she said.

Admitting there’s no set maternity leave for a recording artist, Im revealed she returned to the stage just two weeks after giving birth to Harry.

Wile she doesn’t work 9-5 hours, she’s never had trouble finding quality time to spend with family. But she recalled navigating an identity shift from “independent woman” to one who became reliant upon others just so she could go to work.

“I didn’t have a lot of role models to help me picture what it was going to be like, and that’s why I was so scared,” Im revealed.

Seeking a mentor to guide her through the uncharted waters, the performer found one in her former TV singing coach Dannii Minogue.

Oblivious to the star’s juggling act when they met, Im now has endless respect for Minogue’s ability to balance both worlds.

“When I worked with her on The X Factor all those years ago, that’s when she had her son who was probably that similar age to where my kids are at, and he was toilet training and all of that,” she said.

“She worked right through and at the time, I had no idea, I didn’t know that. How did she do it?”

Im also has a newfound appreciation for children’s entertainers like The Wiggles who are able to craft catchy tunes that don’t drive parents completely insane.

When seeking the sound of silence at home, or at least when tired of hearing her own singing voice, the Korean-born artist turns to K-Pop for peace.

She imagines “every toddler parent in Australia” has jumped on Netflix’s viral KPop Demon Hunters film, dubbing it the new Frozen.

Leaving Korea at the age of nine, the Brisbane native naturally grew up idolising pop musicians who sang in her language.

But despite the genre’s recent penetration of the mainstream — think BTS and BLACKPINK — she could never thrive in that environment.

“I don’t think I have what it takes to be a K-Pop singer, to be honest. Because it’s a very different skill set,” she said.

“I’ve recorded the latest album that I did which is all about Jazz Pop. So it’s quite different to the shiny K-Pop that I appreciate, but I think I’m just a different kind of real old soul.”

Im was awarded an honorary doctorate in July following the completion of her Master of Music in Contemporary Voice majoring in Jazz at Griffith University.

However, perhaps the more satisfying achievement was her decision to leave Sony Music to release an album on her terms.

“I’m at a really good place in my career where I’ve got my own label and I can choose to do what feels most true to me, rather than worrying about what the label wants,” she said.

As Im’s latest single Bubble reflects, instead of masking her inspiration from artists like Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald, she’s embracing it.

Released last week, the song encapsulates her family’s move into a new home that cocooned them from all of the world’s politics and external noise.

“I just sometimes want to not think about that and just live in my little bubble and just ignore everything, and feel like everything’s perfect,” she said.

364074698,Hamas says it has not received US peace proposal,"Hamas has not received US President Donald Trump’s Gaza Strip ceasefire plan, the Palestinian militant group which runs the enclave says as Israeli forces expand their assault on Gaza City.

The comments came after Israeli newspaper Haaretz cited sources saying Hamas had agreed in principle to release all the Israeli hostages it holds in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and the gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops under Mr Trump’s plan.

Also included in the proposal were the end of Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip and Israel agreeing not to annex the territory and drive out Palestinians living there, Haaretz reported.

“Hamas has not been presented with any plan,” a Hamas official who asked not to be named told Reuters.

In his comments to reporters on Friday in which he said “it’s looking like we have a deal on Gaza,” Trump offered no details of its contents and gave no timetable.

Israel has not yet made any public response to Mr Trump’s comments.

Mr Trump is due on Monday to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who heads a governing coalition opposed to ending the Gaza Strip war until Hamas is destroyed.

Mr Trump also said on Friday talks on the conflict with Middle Eastern countries were intense and would continue as long as required.

His special envoy Steve Witkoff said the US president had presented proposals to the leaders of multiple Muslim-majority countries this week that included a 21-point Middle East peace plan.

In the Gaza Strip meanwhile, the fighting continued.

The Israeli military said its aircraft struck 120 targets across the strip over the past day as troops pressed deeper into Gaza City.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 74 people were killed in the enclave in the last 24 hours.

In a post on social media platform X, the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesman repeated calls for Gaza City residents to leave.

The United Nations World Food Programme estimates that 350,000-400,000 Palestinians have left since Israel began its expanded ground offensive in Gaza City a couple of weeks ago but hundreds of thousands remain.

Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres said late on Friday it had been forced to suspend its medical activities in Gaza City because its clinics were encircled by Israeli forces.

The group said the move was the “last thing” it wanted, saying that vulnerable people such as infants in neonatal care and people with life-threatening illnesses are unable to move and are in grave danger.

Four health facilities in Gaza City have shut down so far this month, according to the World Health Organisation, and the UN says some malnutrition centres have also closed.

Israel began its assault on the Gaza Strip nearly two years ago after an attack led by Hamas killed about 1200 people, with 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in the enclave, according to Gazan health authorities, displaced the entire population and crippled the territory’s health system.",Media reports say Hamas has agreed to free its hostages in return for a gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops but the group says it has not seen a US proposal.,https://thewest.com.au/news/world/hamas-says-it-has-not-received-us-peace-proposal-c-20165285,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20165285/97949e0df5c5873f0f6ade269b392c5f2d229db4-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-09-27 21:53:12,Staff Writers,['Staff Writers'],en,politics,au,-0.185
364078646,Rocky Horror at 50 is still a home for misfits and dreamers,"Few pop culture phenomena have endured the test of time as well as The Rocky Horror Picture Show. 

Turning 50 this year, the film maintains an unmatched legacy of the longest-running theatrical release in history.

For a cult film originally considered a commercial flop, Rocky Horror reshaped film, fashion, punk and musical theatre, and became a touchstone for the early LGBTQIA+ movement.

German filmmaker Andreas Zerr has spent the past 10 years interviewing cast, crew and fans across the United States, United Kingdom and Australia for his documentary film Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon Of Rocky Horror.

He said it would be impossible to replicate a comparable cult enigma today.

""Nothing like that had ever been done before.

""At the time Rocky Horror became successful, only cinema and television programs existed, so people were actively seeking somewhere else for entertainment.

Peculiarity of stage and screen

The Rocky Horror Show emerged from the gender-bending Glam Rock era of the early 1970s.

It was a time when David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust epitomised androgyny in rock music, and musicals such as Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar propelled counterculture onto the mainstream stage.

The burlesque pastiche of Rocky Horror was originally penned as a stage musical by British-New Zealand actor, writer and musician Richard O'Brien, who played Riff Raff in the film.

It follows the story of a stranded couple who take refuge in the castle of promiscuous mad scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), who is about to unveil his Frankenstein-like creation, a muscle man lover, to a crowd of oddball Transylvanians.

His debaucherous quest is set to a soundtrack of satirical show numbers, unravelling into an absurdist cabaret of polyamorous seduction, self-discovery, murder, mayhem and mutiny.

""At the time, LGBTQ wasn't accepted at all,"" Mr Zerr said of the show's sexual ambiguity being ahead of its time.

The stage production premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1973 — it was a roaring success and migrated to various other theatres during its seven-year, 2,960-performance run.

But it was the stage show's success in America that year which led to the film.

Worldwide cult following

Produced by Lou Adler and Michael White, directed by Jim Sharman on a budget of about $US1 million, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was shot over six weeks in London.

The film featured key cast and crew from the original stage production, with the addition of American actors Susan Sarandon (Janet), Barry Bostwick (Brad) and rising rock star Meatloaf (Eddie).

Released in 1975 by 20th Century Fox, the film was initially considered a commercial flop and relegated to midnight screenings.

The movie had an unexpected second wind in 1976, when audiences in New York City returned night after night to midnight screenings.

Dressed as the characters and talking back at the screen, fans would throw rice, put newspapers over their heads and shoot squirt guns.

The audience participation spawned a ""shadow cast"" movement, where costumed fans would lip-sync lines, lyrics, and play out the action live in front of the big screen.

Rocky Horror pride

With performance rights being granted to community theatre groups for the first time, regional theatre ensembles, like the Maffra Dramatic Society in Victoria, have embraced the opportunity to perform Rocky Horror.

With a cast of all shapes, sizes, ages, genders, races and identities making perfect sense in the world of Rocky Horror, first-time director Haylee Treasure said the inclusive nature of the show spoke to the younger generation.

She said the show was seen as a celebration of gender diversity, creative, quirky, introverted and oddball types, and cosplay enthusiasts.

Although many musicals have been revised in recent times, with the removal of racist and sexist language, Ms Treasure said the Maffra Dramatic Society would be ""staying true to the original Rocky"".","The Rocky Horror Picture Show film still screens in cinemas around the world, captivating a new generation of cinemagoers.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/fifty-years-of-rocky-horror-picture-show-film/105804794,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f3e76c540b864de725cec47038f9cca7?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1152&cropW=2048&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:51:11,Rachael Lucas,['Rachael Lucas'],en,,AU,0.272
364074696,Madhya Pradesh: Five-year-old boy beheaded in front of mother in home invasion,"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENTA five-year-old boy was reportedly beheaded in front of his mother by a 25-year-old man who broke into their home.

Suspect Mahesh allegedly grabbed a sharp spade found inside the house and attacked the young boy, severing his neck from his torso.

India has been left in shock by the dreadful attack, which took place yesterday in Madhya Pradesh, a central state.

The child’s mother was also injured while trying to save her son.

Upon hearing her cries, locals rushed to help and severely beat the attacker, who later died on the way to hospital.

Authorities revealed he had been missing from his home for nearly four days.

He had also reportedly attempted to steal from a nearby shop about an hour before the attack.

The cause of death for the child is yet to be confirmed and will be established after a post-mortem.

A case has been registered against the suspect.

Dhar Superintendent of Police Mayank Awasthi confirmed the death and said a judicial inquiry has been launched to determine the cause.

He said: “The actual situation will become clear after the post-mortem report is released.

Police investigations revealed that they had no acquaintance or grudge against the murderer. The police are conducting a detailed investigation.”

The shocking assault comes just months after a tourist and her travel host were gang-raped while stargazing.

Police chief Ram L Arasiddi explained the vile attack started when the host took four guests – two Israeli women, two Indian men, and a US man – stargazing near a canal in Koppal.

Three suspects on a motorbike approached, initially asking for petrol, then demanding money.

They threw the three men into the canal, killing one Indian traveller, while the others survived.

They then attacked the two women, beating and sexually assaulting them before fleeing.

The case shook India, with Karnataka’s state president B Y Vijayendra saying protections for women remain insufficient.

He added authorities continue to be “delusional and indifferent.”

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said: “Our government is committed to providing protection to everyone, including tourists, coming to the state.”

“All necessary measures will be taken to ensure that such incidents do not recur.”",A man who stormed into the home of a five-year-old boy and his mother has been brutally attacked outside by neighbours.

364078648,Russian minister warns NATO any aggression will be met with a 'decisive response',"As new tensions rise between Russia and NATO powers, Moscow's top diplomat says his nation doesn't intend to attack Europe but will mount a ""decisive response"" to any aggression.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke at the UN General Assembly following a spate of incursions into NATO's airspace — intrusions the alliance blames on Russia — that have raised alarm around Europe. After which NATO jets downed drones over Poland, and Estonia said Russian fighter jets flew into its territory and lingered for 12 minutes.

Russia has denied that its planes entered Estonian airspace and has said the drones didn't target Poland, with Moscow's ally Belarus maintaining that Ukrainian signal-jamming sent the devices off course.

But European leaders see the incidents as intentional, provocative moves meant to rattle NATO and to suss how the alliance will respond. The alliance warned Russia last week that NATO would use all means to defend against any further breaches of its airspace.

At the UN, Mr Lavrov maintained that Russia was facing threats.

""Russia has never had and does not have any such intentions"" of attacking European or NATO countries, he said.

""However, any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in NATO and the EU.""

Speaking three years into the Ukraine war

Mr Lavrov spoke three years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a war that the international community has broadly deplored.

US President Donald Trump said this week that he believed Ukraine could win back all the territory it has lost to Russia. It was a notable shift in tone from a US leader who had previously suggested Ukraine would need to make some concessions and could never reclaim all the areas Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, and launching a full-scale invasion in 2022.

Just three weeks earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country and the US had a ""mutual understanding"" and that Mr Trump's administration ""is listening to us"". Mr Trump and Mr Putin held a summit in Alaska in early August, but left without a deal to end the war.

Sounding a notably open note from a country that has often lambasted the West, Mr Lavrov noted the summit and said Russia had ""some hopes"" to keep talking with the US.

""In the approaches of the current US administration, we see a desire not only to contribute to ways to realistically resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but also a desire to develop pragmatic cooperation without adopting an ideological stance,"" the diplomat said.

Portraying the powers as counterparts of sorts, he said: ""Russia and the US bear a special responsibility for the state of affairs in the world, and for avoiding risks that could plunge humanity into a new war.""

To be sure, Mr Lavrov still had sharp words for NATO, an alliance that includes the US, and for the West in general and the European Union.

Trump's emerging view of Ukraine is part of the equation

Mr Trump's new view of Ukraine's prospects came after he met with its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Tuesday — seven months after a televised blow-up between the two in the Oval Office. This time, the doors were closed, and the tenor was evidently different — ""a good meeting,"" as Mr Zelenskyy described it in his assembly speech the next day.

For the fourth year in a row, Mr Zelenskyy appealed to the gathering of presidents, prime ministers and other top officials to get Russia out of his country — and warned that inaction would put other countries at risk.

""Ukraine is only the first,"" he said.

Russia has offered various explanations for the Ukraine war, among them ensuring Russia's own security after NATO expanded eastward over the years and drew closer to Ukraine after Russia's move into Crimea. Russia has also said its offensive was meant to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine and the West have denounced Russia's invasion as an unprovoked act of aggression.

Russia condemns Israel's attack on Gaza

Addressing the devastating war in Gaza, Mr Lavrov condemned Hamas militants' surprise attack in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, but said ""there is no justification"" for Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians, including children.

The Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel; 251 were taken hostage. Israel's sweeping offensive has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not give a breakdown of civilian and combatant deaths but says around half of those killed were women and children.

Mr Lavrov also said there was no basis for any potential Israeli annexation of the West Bank, which Palestinians consider a key part of their future state, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem.

Israel hasn't announced such a move, but several leading members in Benjamin Netanyahu's government have advocated doing so. Officials recently approved a controversial settlement project that would effectively cut the West Bank in two, a move critics say could doom chances for a Palestinian state.

Between the war in Gaza and the situation in the West Bank, ""we are essentially dealing with an attempt at a kind of coup d'etat aimed at burying UN decisions on the creation of a Palestinian state,"" Mr Lavrov said.

The international community has long embraced a ""two-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

But Mr Netanyahu rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, saying it would reward Hamas — a position he reiterated on Friday at the General Assembly.","While Russia does not intend to attack Europe, its Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has not ruled out action against NATO aggression.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-warns-nato-europe-at-unga/105825572,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a73e4f67c8401f0f2cebc8ae3323c66f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:30:42,ABC News,['ABC News'],en,politics,AU,-0.098
364078644,Nine-year-old surfer returns to the water weeks after shark attack,"Bowie Daly has returned to surfing weeks after surviving a frightening shark attack on the NSW far south coast.

The nine-year-old was at Tathra Beach on August 7 when a shark grabbed his surfboard.

The shark let go and a group of nearby surfers, including Bowie's father, helped him get to shore.

Bowie sustained some bruising and scratches, a hole in his wetsuit and a broken board.

It's only taken Bowie a matter of weeks to get back into the water — at first swimming near the shore before moving to boogie boarding and then surfing.

He said he was glad to be back, but the shark encounter played on his mind.

""If it's murky water and there's no-one out, I'm a bit scared,"" he said.

""If it's clear water and there's a few people out, then I'm fine.

Bowie said he was thinking more about what could happen when he was surfing, but that being accompanied by friends or family while in the water put him more at ease.

His father, Simon Daly, said he had noticed changes in his son.

""If there's no-one in the water, he turns to me and says, 'I'm thinking about it again', and I am too, to be honest,"" he said.

""I think it will be something that over time will lessen.""

One day at a time

Mr Daly said his son's attack was a harrowing experience, but their stance on sharing the ocean with sharks had not changed.

""I've always rested really comfortably with surfing and sharing the same environment as sharks,"" he said.

""We're out there in the sharks' environment and they're doing their thing, and we're doing our thing.

""That's why we cohabitate so well.""

Not long after the attack, Bowie set a goal of getting back in the water within a couple of weeks.

He then became an ambassador for Surfaid's Make a Wave challenge in which he had to surf every day for the month of September.

It motivated him to get back into the water daily and raise funds to provide clean water and health care to remote surfing villages.

""It's been a bit hard, but I can do it,"" Bowie said.

Mr Daly said the challenge ""dovetailed"" with his son's own drive to get back into the surf.

""Each day, he still definitely has his little battles, which I would as well,"" Mr Daly said.

""The connection to the ocean is always there for him … but it is a delicate thing getting back in.

Bowie's recovery has not gone unnoticed.

Dave Pearson was severely injured in 2011 when he was bitten by a three-metre bull shark during an afternoon surf on the NSW Mid North Coast.

He founded Bite Club, a group for people who have lived through similar experiences and were looking for support.

Younger surfers who survived shark attacks were usually more resilient than adults when it came to getting back into the water, he said, adding that he admired their strength.

""They're so great at getting back in,"" Mr Pearson said.

Mr Pearson said he was still ""spooked"" when he was in the water, and was a ""bit more careful"" before heading out for a surf.

He said it took time for survivors, as well as their loved ones, to fully recover from a shark attack.

He recommended surfing with people to mentally cope.

""It's going to be every time they paddle out, he's going to think about sharks, but they'll get through it.

""The more people that go out with them, the better it's going to be for him.

""Make it a massive deal and a massive celebration.""",Bowie Daly may be back in the surf but he says the near miss still plays on his mind.,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/bowie-daly-returns-to-surfing-weeks-after-shark-attack/105788210,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d747efbc232fca8c540929a73c1ab4c1?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1358&cropW=2415&xPos=0&yPos=161&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:22:02,Adriane Reardon,['Adriane Reardon'],en,,AU,0.066
364078604,Brisbane Lions fans bask in back-to-back AFL Grand Final glory,"For the second year in a row, Brisbane Lions fans are celebrating a dominant grand final win.

After a tight first half that saw scores level at half-time, Brisbane pulled away and never looked back, pouring on 13 goals in the second half to cruise to a 47-point victory.

For Brisbane fans, the day may have held a sense of deja vu, following a 60-point demolition of the Sydney Swans in last year's grand final.

But the encore performance did nothing to dampen the excitement of the Brisbane faithful, who worked up a frenzy at a hotel in the shadow of Brisbane's famous Story Bridge.

As the final siren sounded, the crowd erupted in celebration, the heartbreak from their close loss in the 2023 showpiece now a distant memory.

The mood was markedly more subdued in Geelong, where fans watched the dying moments of the game at Eastern Beach.

The dour mood there was compounded by the weather, as rain started to drench the thousands of fans who turned out to watch the game at the live site.

Back in Melbourne, diehard Brisbane fans who were unable to get a ticket to the game gathered at the Royal Derby Hotel in Fitzroy, the Victorian home of the Brisbane Lions.

One Lions fan said he was in disbelief that the side had overcome adversity to win it all.

""I can't believe it, we lost [Joe] Daniher, all these injuries, and we're back again this year,"" he said.

""Look out, we've got another three or four coming on.""

Another fan couldn't help but get a dig in at Geelong, which beat the Lions convincingly in the first week of the finals.

""What a win, to beat Geelong like that, and they are a pretty boring club, aren't they?"" he said.

The evening in Fitzroy was sound-tracked by the classic hits that now play when a Lions player kicks a goal, with fans standing on tables to belt out Take Me Home Country Roads — Charlie Cameron's signature tune.

The celebration continued at Yarra Park, where players showed the cup off to cheering fans.

For Brisbane fans hoping to keep the party going just a little longer, the team will have its fan day at Brunswick St Oval in Fitzroy on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Geelong fans will have an opportunity to commiserate together at their fan day at St Mary's Oval at Kardinia Park.","For the second year in a row, Brisbane Lions fans were celebrating in the streets as their team claimed the premiership.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/afl-grand-final-lions-and-cats-fan-reactions/105824822,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/70d3912d639ee6ccbc4bb01a193944fc?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2811&cropW=4997&xPos=3&yPos=0&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:16:08,ABC News,['ABC News'],en,,au,-0.076

Sebastian Robinson smokes allegedly a joint with indigenous ranger in ""dry"" Arnhem Land

The Northern Territory police will next week confirm whether there is any ongoing investigation into the pilot involved in a fatal chopper crash that killed crocodile egg collector Chris “Willow” Wilson, after a court heard evidence of the pilot having used cocaine in the hours before the flight and evidence the helicopter ran out of fuel.
Celebrity crocodile wrangler Matt Wright was convicted of two counts of perverting the course of justice over his actions in the aftermath of the crash in West Arnhem Land in 2022 that killed his best mate Chris “Willow” Wilson.

Sebastian Robinson allegedly smokes a joint with an indigenous ranger

Mr Robinson also gave...

He has lodged an appeal that will be heard on October 7.
The pilot, Sebastian Robinson, suffered multiple spinal fractures in the crash, rendering him paraplegic.
During evidence in the highly-publicised four-week trial of Wright, Mr Robinson said that while he had no memory of the crash due to his injuries, he accepted he “must have intentionally disconnected” Wilson from the sling that was suspending him 25 metres above the ground.

Outback Wrangler Matt Wright has marked his 46th birthday during his trial.
An ATSB report into the cause of the crash – which is protected by the Transport Information Safety Act and therefore could not be used as evidence in a Supreme Court trial – found that the helicopter was “likely not refuelled at the en route fuel depot, which was about three quarters of the way between the departure location on the outskirts of Darwin and a clearing near King River where the helicopter and crew were to commence crocodile egg collecting”. 
The report also found the pilot did not identify the reducing fuel state before the helicopter’s engine stopped in flight due to fuel exhaustion.

“During the subsequent autorotation, the pilot released the egg collector above a likely-survivable height, fatally injuring them. 
“The pilot then completed the autorotation to the ground, but there was insufficient main rotor energy to cushion the landing. This resulted in serious injuries to the pilot and substantial damage to the helicopter.”

The ATSB report states people who attended the site after the crash reported “examination of the cowls (engine covers) did not identify any discolouration that would be associated with leaking fuel, either prior to, or after the accident”.

Wright and his wife Kaia Wright approach the Supreme Court in Darwin.

Chris 'Willow' Wilson's widow, Dani Wilson, gives her speech to the media after Outback Wrangler Matt Wright found guilty of allegations he conspired to cover up details of the helicopter crash that killed Chris.
Two ATSB inesvtigators confirmed there was no fuel at the crash site. “There was no fuel smell, no fuel in the auxiliary tank and a very small quanitity of fuel in the main tank.”
A Careflight first responder “reported that there was no smell or indication of fuel”.
And an additional two independent people who were engaged by the AYSB to recover the wreck also stated there was no sign or smell of fuel at the site and that an angel-grinder was safely used to cut apart the helicopter which could never have been done if fuel was present.
The ATSB also found that the “pilot’s exposure to cocaine within the previous few days increased the likelihood of fatigue, depression and inattention” however it said there was “insufficient evidence to determine whether these effects occurred”.
The Transport Safety Investigation Act states that published ATSB reports must not be used in any criminal proceedings. 
The trial heard additional evidence separate to the ATSB report of drug use and evidence that the Robinson R44 with call sign VH-IDW, owned by Wright, ran out of fuel.
The prosecution argued the drug use was not a factor in the crash, and rejected the argument of fuel exhaustion.

Seb Robinson's brother Zac Chellingworth speaking outside of court following the verdict.
NT Police and the DPP have been asked whether the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing. 
A police spokesman said on Thursday that an answer would be given next week.
Robinson has not been charged with any offences relating to the fatal crash or the evidence heard at Wright’s criminal trial. 
Text messages referring to “coke” and “footy players in town” wanting “bags” were scraped from Robinson’s mobile phone and tendered in the case against Wright, the star of the Netflix reality adventure show Wild Croc Territory.
The messages appear on Snapchat and other chat forums between 2018 and 2021.
In one of the messages tendered to the court in Wright’s proceedings, an unknown person wrote: “Hey sebby any chance of booking you out for a day next week tues to Friday to do some cool shit if your not too busy 12 hours and coke bonus”.

Text messages, such as the one above, were scraped from Robinson’s mobile phone.

Some of the texts referred to “coke” and “footy players in town” wanting “bags”.
Another message to Robinson said: “Anyone got bags” while Robinson appears to have written on another occasion: “I got cash” after telling someone who was “getting some coke” to “get me one”.
In another message: “Thanks for the weekend cobba the fuel cost $1100 so I’ll transfer you another $300 for the coke and another hundred to chip in for the fuel”.
One of the messages sent to Robinson says: “Footy players in town and want bags, RJ got any?”
During the trial Defence Counsel David Edwardson KC said Robinson “had the responsibility of ensuring that he was fit to fly that aircraft, that is, not fly with cocaine in his system”.
“He had the responsibility to refuel the helicopter with the fuel made available by Mick Burns from the preallocated drums at Mount Borradaile. These are matters that fell entirely within the responsibility of Sebastian Robinson as the pilot of IDW on 28 February 2022.

Pilot in command Sebastian Robinson is pictured asleep in the passenger seat next to Chris ""Willow"" Wilson.
“These are matters that have absolutely nothing to do with Matt Wright. They are all Sebastian Robinson specific.”
Mr Edwardson told the jury Wright didn’t know the Robinson “had been partying in the day or days leading up to the crash”. 
“Matt Wright didn’t know that Sebastian Robinson had cocaine in his system at the time of the crash. Matt Wright didn’t know that Sebastian Robinson had released Chris Wilson from a fatal height of 25 metres. 
“Matt Wright didn’t know of the possibility that Sebastian Robinson had failed to refuel IDW at Mount Borradaile. Matt Wright didn’t know that the likely cause of the crash was fuel exhaustion.

“Matt Wright had no idea that the ATSB inquiry would suggest that the cause of the crash was probably fuel exhaustion. In essence Matt Wright knew bugger all.”
He said “What we do know” is that Robison had likely consumed on the expert evidence cocaine within four to eight hours of flying that helicopter, and that according to the experts … this immediately gives rise to the possibility of potential fatigue at the time of the accident, due to rebound effects following cocaine use and possibly due to sleep deprivation caused by insomnia arising from cocaine use and judgment, perception, decision-making and memory impairment”. 
“That is the evidence that was read into the transcript, if you like, a potted summary, of the potential side effects or effects of somebody who has taken cocaine at a time proximate to the accident.”
The defence also pointed to Robinson’s brother Zac Chellingworth as having “quite a role to play”. 

Pilot Sebastian Robinson (L) with Chris 'Willow' Wilson.

He was “getting the inside running with the ATSB”. 
“He was the person that, as the investigation was unfolding with the ATSB, was taking photographs of the crashed helicopter, was sending text messages to Sebastian Robinson, particularly referable to this issue, this vexed question of no fuel”.
“He, like his brother, was on notice that that is exactly where the direction of the inquiry was going and, quite understandably can I suggest, why the collective clan would have been extremely concerned about the very real prospect that Sebastian Robinson might be held accountable for flying that aircraft high on cocaine and If ever there was a person that had an incentive to try and deflect from his conduct, it was him and his extended family.”
The defence also argued Robinson was not a credible witness.
“Another matter that goes to the credit and therefore reliability of Sebastian Robinson is his denial that he is a consumer of cannabis,” Mr Edwardson said.
“When presented with various text messages and indeed, self-made videos on his phone, despite the joint or cannabis by pipe – or whatever, in those videos, he denied that he was smoking cannabis or that he was a consumer of cannabis.

The helicopter carrying Chris 'Willow' Wilson crashed in remote West Arnhem Land in February, 2022.
“If that is true, why was he texting his mother asking his mother if he can get ‘some green from Aunty Di’ or, on another occasion, ‘Johnny ‘.”
Crown Prosecutor Jason Gullaci SC told the jury that Robinson “on occasion got cocaine and provided it to his friends and the friends paid for their share – not for profit”. 
“It wasn’t suggested – not once – that Sebastian Robinson was the drug baron of the Northern Territory – the Tony Mokbel or Carl Williams of the North – not once. It wasn’t put that he was in this for profit,” he said.
Mr Robinson’s use of cocaine in the days prior “certainly doesn’t make him responsible for the crash”, Mr Gullaci told the jury.
“Mr Robinson used cocaine. I think I said that in the opening, there was cocaine in his system, so you wouldn’t have been shocked by that,” he said in his closing address.
“He bought cocaine too – as I put to him. Unless there’s some different phenomenon in the Northern Territory from every other State and territory in Australia, you don’t get cocaine for free. So if you want to use it, if you are someone that occasionally recreationally uses it, which is what he said he did, well, guess what, you’ve got to buy it.”
The prosecution rejected the suggestion the chopper was not refuelled, pointing to a photograph that showed the reserve tank was three-quarters full and another witness, Timothy Luck, who said he was “very confident” he refuelled the chopper at Mount Borradaile shortly before the crash.
Robinson could not remember but told jurors he “knew in his heart” that the helicopter did not run out of fuel during the crash, and described other accounts as “rumours and whispers”.

The ATSB report stated: “There was no evidence of fuel leaks on the transmission deck, from either tank or associated fuel lines” and “no fuel in the auxiliary tank and a very small quantity of unusable fuel at the bottom of the main tank.”
The ATSB report concluded that “external examination found no evidence of a catastrophic engine failure.” 
“There was also no evidence of failure or defects to the airframe or the helicopter’s systems likely to have contributed to the accident.”
The egg collecting trip started from Darwin with blue fuel in the helicopter. 
The plan was to refuel with green fuel at Mount Borradaile before heading to the King River preparation area for the egg collecting.
However, the ATSB found only blue fuel, not green, in the crashed aircraft.
The court heard the helicopter burns at least 60 litres per hour, yet only a tiny 250 millilitres of blue fuel – an “unusable quantity” – was drained from it, suggesting a severe fuel shortage. 
The ATSB and court evidence also showed there was no fuel pump available for Mr Luck to use at Mount Borradaile, as the other two machines’ pumps had already been packed up. And Mr Luck’s evidence in court was that the reason he refuelled IDW was because Willow and Seb were pulling the dual controls out. 
But the court heard from other witnesses, that the dual controls remained in place in the helicopter until the staging area just before the crash occurred.

Out of the eight people present, one is deceased, and Sebastian Robinson doesn’t have any memories, only Mr Luck remembers IDW being refuelled.
Mr Edwardson argued “Mr Luck is either a Seb supporter and has come to support his mate on this topic of refuelling or, alternatively, Tim Luck was mistaken about refuelling IDW.
Either way, we say he cannot be correct”.

364061796,The crime bosses that wreaked havoc on Sydney a century ago,"Sydney is no stranger to violence spilling onto the streets, with bloody gangsters ruling the city and dominated the headlines a century ago.

Now known for their trendy apartments, bars and eateries, Darlinghurst, Surry Hills, Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross were once the scene of an organised crime battle in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

This era's crime bosses were fighting for control of the criminal underworld.

Historian Max Burns-McRuvie runs a tour company that delves into this history.

Some of the tours focus on the razor gang wars — a time when straight shaving blades were the weapon of choice to void exposure to laws that meant automatic jail time for anyone caught carrying an unlicensed firearm.

""There was this 1920s attitude of anti-authority, finding ways around the law and a mixture of gangsters and glamour,"" Mr Burns-McRuvie said

'Queen of the underworld': Kate Leigh

Kate Leigh went from poor origins to owning a criminal empire.

A part-time crook in her youth, Leigh slowly became known as ""queen of the underworld"" and ""sly grog queen"".

After multiple police run-ins, Leigh turned her attention to the illegal, clandestine sale of alcohol during the era's mandatory 6pm pub closures.

""It was a perfect storm — men coming back from war with shell shock, wanting to drink and couldn't get it legally after 6pm. She seemed to take all of her criminal experience and become a sly grogger,"" said Mr Burns-McRuvie.

Leigh reigned over Sydney's sly-grog market before adding cocaine distribution to her criminal portfolio.

James Findlay, a University of Sydney lecturer in Australian history, said Leigh was both feared and respected by different groups.

""She was cast in the press as the embodiment of the underworld menace,"" Dr Findlay said.

""A woman wielding power in a criminal economy fed into broader anxieties about female respectability at the time.""

One fellow gangster said in a 1990 biography: ""If you were sweet with Kate, she'd do anything for you and give you anything. But if you crossed her, she'd shoot you.""

Despite her list of rival enemies, Leigh was seen as a ""matriarch for the working class"", and she died aged 82.

""She was harsh but protective of her community,"" said Dr Findlay.

""She always had muscle on hand.""

Equal to Leigh's level of notoriety during the razor gang wars, there was another female crime boss — both determined to come out on top.

'Queen of the night': Tilly Devine

Born Matilda Twiss in London, when she moved to Sydney she used the name Tilly Devine.

After working in a factory in her teens, Devine turned to sex work and learned ""how to hold her own"".

She fell in love with a client, an Australian soldier, and the pair married and moved Down Under, where he became her ""pimp on the streets"", said Mr Burns-McRuvie.

""She was a headache to the courts,"" he added, noting an incident in 1925 when Devine slashed a man's arms and face with a razor on Crown Street for staring at her.

Following a prison stint, Devine turned her attention to running brothels.

The NSW Vagrancy (Amendment) Act 1905 prohibited men living off the earnings of sex workers — though it made no mention of women instead running the brothels.

The loophole meant Devine became a madam, with her husband selling cocaine out of the brothels.

She became known as ""Queen of Woolloomooloo"" and ""Queen of the night"".

""At the same time, we shouldn't romanticise her — violence, intimidation and exploitation were central to her business model.""

Her relationship with rival Leigh was fraught.

""When they both started to become wealthy and powerful, they got into territorial wars,"" Mr Burns-McRuvie said.

Dr Findlay said it remained ""one of the most notorious feuds in Australian criminal history"".

""They were both fiercely protective of their criminal empires.

""They traded insults in the press and newspapers loved this story of two vice queens battling for Sydney.""

In her final years Devine lost much of her wealth to unpaid income tax and fines. She died aged 70.

'Sly-grogging and selling cocaine': Phillip Jeffs

Phillip 'Phil the Jew' Jeffs was not just a heavy muscle thug used as a pawn during Leigh and Devine's battle, but a rival in his own right.

""He was involved in gun shootings, sly-grogging and selling cocaine,"" Mr Burns-McRuvie said.

While a lot of the other men in this era were killed or jailed, Jeffs stepped back and poured a lot of the money he made into one of Sydney's early illegal casinos — the 50-50 club.

""It was all about cocaine being freely sold in there and sly grogging. He managed to have society folk, police and politicians on his pay role,"" Mr Burns-McRuvie said.

""He had organised crime on his side.""

Jeffs took his earnings and retired up to the Central Coast before his death aged 48.

Australia's 'inherent fascination with crime'

For the public who remain fascinated with this part of history, Dr Findlay said it comes down to a multitude of reasons.

First is the gendered element of the razor gang wars — the enduring influence of figures like Devine and Leigh.

Second is Australia's ""inherent fascination with crime"" from Ned Kelly to recent true crime cases.

Third is the interwar period itself.

""There's sex, drugs, violence, plus the glamour of the Jazz age. Many people were living life in the moment after experiencing the cataclysmic events of the first World War,"" Dr Findlay said.

""The razor gang wars also provide us with a really fascinating window into Sydney's urban life during the interwar years — particularly how restrictive laws on alcohol, sex work and weapons unintentionally created a thriving black market for the working class.""","From the 'queen of the underworld' to a razor gang slasher in control of an underworld empire, these were the bosses at the centre of an organised crime battle in the late 1920s and early 1930s.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/1920s-razor-gang-crime-bosses-that-wreaked-havoc-on-sydney/105749468,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8f006a7c9c86499252634a24b740c252?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1080&cropW=1920&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:06:22,Isabella Ross,['Isabella Ross'],en,,AU,0.146
364061800,Queensland's coal mining royalty regime back in spotlight after job cuts,"When Queensland introduced a shake-up to its coal royalties regime, the government was accused of killing the state's ""golden goose"" by the sector's peak body.

The move to implement additional tiers in 2022 — the first change to royalties in a decade — came when coal prices were at a record high, and netted Queensland $15.3 billion in revenue the following financial year.

The state's tiered scheme remains in place today, despite a change of government and criticisms from the industry.

The issue is back at the fore after three coal companies announced job cuts in Queensland's Bowen Basin last week, with BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) citing ""unsustainable coal royalties"" alongside market conditions as reasons for the decision.

How the royalties work

Queensland's coal royalties scheme works on a sliding scale.

The rate starts from 7 per cent — when prices are below $100 per tonne — to a peak of 40 per cent when prices are over $300/t.

Miners pay more as coal prices go up — 20 per cent at $175/t, 30 per cent at $225/t and 40 per cent when prices topped $300/t.

University of Queensland economics professor John Quiggin said this means when the coal prices are high, the state gets a ""reasonable share"" rather than it all going towards company profits.

When the new regime was introduced in 2022, then-premier Annastacia Palaszczuk made no apologies.

""If the coal companies are making record prices, then they should return some of that share to Queenslanders,"" she said at the time.

The move was slammed by the Queensland Resources Council (QRC), which launched a campaign warning of the ""potential damage and job losses"" the change could cause.

A trifecta of announcements

Last week, BMA announced it would cut about 750 jobs across its operations and that its Saraji South mine at Dysart would be mothballed from November.

The next day, Anglo American confirmed job losses at its Brisbane offices and across its Bowen Basin operations.

The company declined to detail the number of redundancies, but Isaac Regional Council said more than 200 positions were involved.

The third announcement in as many days came from QCOAL, with one of its two underground sites at the Cook Colliery mine, near Blackwater in Central Queensland, to shut down in early October.

QRC chief executive Janette Hewson said companies winding back operations in Queensland should not come as a surprise to the state government.

""We have always been saying that royalties are going to hurt us as Queenslanders and now we are seeing the impacts of that,"" she said.

The move by companies to reference coal royalties as one of the factors contributing to its decisions has prompted rebuke from both sides of politics.

Opposition Leader Steven Miles said companies, including BMA, had not shuttered mines when the royalties first came in, but were only doing so now as markets had fallen.

""The coal price is now much lower than it has been over recent years and this didn't occur when those prices were higher, which is when those aggressive coal royalties would have kicked in more substantially,"" he said last week.

Meanwhile, Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie defended the government's decision not to move on royalties, saying it was doing everything it could to ensure Queensland was ""open for business"".

""We are not at war with the mining sector, we are approving leases and mining approvals far more efficiently.""

Pressed on the recent job losses, Premier David Crisafulli reinforced his position to keep the royalty scheme in place — a commitment he made during last year's election campaign.

When asked whether the government would make changes to the royalties scheme from 2028, he said the industry should not hold out hope.

Other factors at play

National MP for Flynn Colin Boyce, whose electorate extends from Gladstone to Emerald, said the decision by mining companies to wind back operations stemmed from a wide range of issues, not just royalties.

He said mining companies were facing pressures from the operational costs of running a mine that had nothing to do with royalties, including the price of electricity, transport and shipping.

""I think David Crisafulli is well within his rights to make his opinions be known and would encourage everybody concerned to understand the wider issue — and it is a lot, lot bigger than just coal royalties,"" he said.

However, he said he advocated for the government sitting down with the industry to understand what the future holds to inform companies planning for the years ahead.

""I do believe the coal industry has a significant future, particularly here in Central Queensland,"" he said.

The impact on state's bottom line

In recent years, a large proportion of the state's revenue has come from coal royalties — reaching a high of $15.36 billion in the 2022-23 financial year followed by $10.52 billion in 2023-24.

That dropped to an estimated $5.49 billion in 2024-25 and $6.17 billion in 2025-26.

In handing down the 2022-23 state budget, which introduced the three additional tiers, then-treasurer Cameron Dick said the government wanted a royalties response that was ""fair and reasonable"" to both coal companies and the people of Queensland.

""At a time of very high profits and very high prices, Queenslanders deserve a share of that to go back precisely into to the jobs and services they need,"" he said.

Central Queensland University (CQU) regional economic development professor John Rolfe said the state government was now raking in almost double what it used to, which was reducing company profits.

He said the royalty scheme was ""hugely important"" to the state's revenue base.

""It makes it hard for the government to adjust the numbers because the fiscal situation is tight, and if they do try and reduce royalties back to a more sensible position, it then puts other parts of the budget into trouble,"" he said.

Across the border in New South Wales, royalties are fixed at a rate of between 8.8 per cent and 10.8 per cent.

MineLife senior resource analyst Gavin Wendt said the fixed rate provided companies with certainty.

""The key factor here is we are not having issues with coal mines in NSW because the royalties system is completely different,"" he said.

""If you are trying to produce a tonne of coal in Queensland, you are losing money — that same tonne of coal in NSW you can be making money.""

The 'key factor' facing Queensland

Following BMA's announcement, the company's asset president Adam Lancey labelled the government's coal royalties as ""unsustainable"".

He said the tiered system meant the company was ""losing the good times"" as it was paying more royalties when prices were high, which it used to count on to ""sustain us through the tougher times"".

In the past decade, BMA's mining operations have funnelled more than $21 billion to the Queensland government, with more $1.5 billion of that having been paid in royalties in the 2024-25 financial year.

Resource Industry Network general manager Dean Kirkwood said the recently announced job cuts could not simply be put down to the cyclical nature of mining, adding: ""We've never had the cost pressures we have had now.""

He said it would be beneficial for the government to provide certainty about coal royalties beyond the next four years.

""It might be simply a case of having an agreement on what royalties will look like in the next term,"" he said.

""Then that gives a bit of surety, doesn't it, around what the future holds and therefore businesses can start to build around that.""

On Friday, Mr Crisafulli met with QRC following a recent trade mission to Japan and India.

The premier has been hinting at an announcement in the coming weeks of ""an exciting new chapter for Queensland coal"".

CQU's Professor Rolfe said the coal industry, which generates up to 40,000 jobs across the state, goes through regular peaks and troughs.

With investments requiring long-term planning from companies, industry watchers will be keeping a keen eye on how Queensland's coal mining royalties, and other factors, play out in this slower period.","Despite a change of government, Queensland's controversial coal royalty scheme remains in place and recent job cuts are prompting renewed discussion about it.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/qld-coal-mine-royalties-regime-questioned-after-job-cuts/105818488,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/59f1ade41f2544b8eca7393e706a1f8f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1125&cropW=2000&xPos=0&yPos=104&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:05:36,Claudia Williams,['Claudia Williams'],en,politics,AU,-0.174
364061792,Algal bloom sea casualties find new life in commercial compost,"Washed-up marine life has become a familiar sight on South Australian coastlines impacted by the ongoing algal bloom.

While cleaning up dead fish has been a bleak task, some of those collections are now being put to good use in the form of compost.

""It's a great resource, although it's a very sad way of getting it,"" said Colin Aagaard, a member of the Kumungka Community Garden in North Brighton.

The SA government estimated about 500 tonnes of marine waste had been cleared from beaches since the bloom hit in March.

From the beach to the garden

When dead sea creatures are cleaned up, they are treated much like the ordinary organic waste a council handles, such as garden clippings and food scraps according to authorities.

Jurisdictions that have a green waste processing service will typically have it taken to handful of sites for commercial compost processing.

""Most of it ends up in farming, but a lot of it ends up back into home gardens or community gardens,"" executive chair of Jeffries Soil, Lachlan Jeffries, said.

Compost is the result of a natural rotting process that happens with all organic material and the natural heat destroys weed seeds and pathogens.

Mr Jeffries said the commercial process took about 15 weeks, so dead marine life from the early days of the bloom made up a fraction of compost being sold today.

""In the overall scheme of what Adelaide recycles from organics, it's quite a small amount,"" he said.

Ian Tanner, who manages the state's algal bloom beach clean-up team, said there was nothing dangerous about the compost — noting that dead sea life was processed in the same way anyone in the community would get rid of their old fish.

""Maybe they order 100 prawns for Christmas, and they don't eat them all, they go in the green bin potentially and they end up in compost, we're doing the same thing,"" he said.

The Kumungka community garden is a short stroll from one of the many beaches impacted the algal bloom.

Mr Aagard said the compost was a win-win for beachgoers and gardeners.

""It takes away all the smelly refuse from the beach, it's all composted and comes back to be available for garden nutrients,"" he said.

""You're creating something natural, putting it back into something natural … it's just a wonderful substance to use.""

Anthony Obst recently planted tomato seedlings using local compost and said he might eat them straight off the plant when they were ready.

""As soon they're ripe I put them in my mouth,"" he said.

On the front line

In July, it was revealed that local councils would receive $1 million in funding to assist with clean-up operations along the coast. 

""The government has stepped up the beach clean-up program from September to support councils, including partnerships with Disaster Relief Australia, IPA Rangers from Point Pearce Aboriginal Corporation, the Goolwa Pipi Company and Surf Life Saving South Australia,"" a spokesperson from the Department of the Premier and Cabinet said. 

""The government is continuing to work through the waste removal arrangements, in liaison with councils, to help keep beaches clean.""

The Department for Environment and Water's Ian Tanner works out of an unassuming office set up in Netley to coordinate the effort.

""About 60 to 80 people on the ground, seven days a week, to help councils clean up the beaches and remove the dead fish,"" he said.

Since the bloom began, most councils have been keen to clear dead fish.

""It's essential that our beaches be as clean as possible,"" said City of Holdfast Bay Mayor, Amanda Wilson.

Onkaparinga Acting Mayor, Lauren Jew, said their council's 31 kilometres of coastline with lots of nooks and crannies made it a challenge to keep clean.

""It takes a lot of people, a lot of resources to do that,"" Ms Jew said.

For smaller wash-ups, the council weighs up whether the tides might simply take the fish back into the ocean.

""Whether or not it can stay and naturally will go back out and resolve itself,"" she said.

Meanwhile, on the sparsely populated Yorke Peninsula, the local council said it had one contractor working in the town of Clinton who has been collecting fish in buckets, as well as support from community members and associations along its 485 kilometres of coastline.

""We do not have beach maintenance crews like many of the metropolitan councils,"" the council's operations manager, Ian Yarrow, said.

""The dead marine life is buried as per guidelines provided by the EPA.""

Ms Wilson said while it was nice something positive can come from beach wash-ups, compost did not solve other issues the community has been facing, like a lack of visitors.

""It would be great if we could go toward the summer having a clean beach where everyone could get back there and really enjoy our beach community,"" she said.","Dead sea life washed ashore during SA's marine algal bloom has been diverted into commercial compost for farms and gardens, in what has been viewed as a small win amid the large-scale devastation.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/algal-bloom-dead-sea-life-turned-to-compost/105807488,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/44113add923fc143d37fd6bff69dc592?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=95&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 21:04:48,Aiden McNamara,['Aiden McNamara'],en,,AU,-0.569
364074690,US President Donald Trump says US troops to ‘protect’ Portland facilities,"US President Donald Trump says he will send troops to Portland, “authorizing Full Force, if necessary” to handle “domestic terrorists” as he expands his deployments to more American cities.

Oregon Democratic Governor Tina Kotek responded by saying Mr Trump was abusing his authority by ordering troops to the a city, which she said is doing “just fine” on its own.

Mr Trump made his announcement on social media, writing that he was directing the Department of Defense to “provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland”.

“This is an American city. We do not need any intervention,” Mayor Keith Wilson said at the news conference.

“This is not a military target.”

Ms Kotek said the president did not give a timetable for troops arriving. She said she told him the Oregon National Guard is not needed and she will call it up. Trump, however, deployed the guard in Los Angeles even though California Governor Gavin Newsom opposed it.

Ms Kotek urged the public to stay calm, saying any kind of property damage or violence won’t be tolerated.

“Let’s not take the bait,” she said.

“Let’s not respond to what the president is trying to do.”

Earlier on Saturday there was no sign of any federal presence downtown, where people jogged along the Willamette River, relaxed by a riverside fountain or rode bikes on a sunny autumn day.

“Where’s the emergency?” asked resident Allen Schmertzler, 72, who said he was “disgusted” by the president’s decision.

Another resident, John McNeur, 74, called Trump’s statement “ridiculous”.

“This place is not a city that’s out of control,” he said.

“It’s just a beautiful place.”

Mr Trump has also named Chicago and Memphis.

Mr Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago but has yet to follow through.

A deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, is expected soon and will include only about 150 troops, far less than were sent to the District of Columbia for Trump’s crackdown on crime or in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the troops’ arrival.

Mr Trump also sent Marines to Los Angeles.

364061802,England wins third Women's Rugby World Cup after defeating Canada in final,"England has outclassed Canada 33-13 in front of a delirious record crowd at Twickenham to win the Women's Rugby World Cup for the third time.

The tournament hosts came into the final having won 62 of their last 63 matches, a stretch spanning six years.

The glaring failure during that period was their agonising World Cup final defeat to New Zealand in 2022.

This time, however, England made no mistake, racing to a 21-8 half-time lead.

The English defended well and finished strongly to extend their record winning run to 33 matches.

They were watched on by 81,886 spectators, which was a world record crowd for a women's rugby match.

""These girls are awesome,"" said coach John Mitchell as England added to its triumphs of 1994 and 2014.

""Three years ago we set about doing something and we finally took the last few steps today.

""I think 2022 taught us a lot. We knew we would be good at the rugby but at the end of the day I think our culture won, with the values that have guided us to this point.

""We can dominate the world for a long time, but the world's going to get better, so this is just the start.""

For England, it was a wonderful occasion to cap off a World Cup that has taken the tournament to new heights.

""This is unimaginable,"" England scrumhalf Natasha Hunt said.

""I am so proud of the girls. I hope this stays for women's rugby.""

Canada takes early lead

Canada, which had to crowd-fund its trip, stole a lineout and sent Asia Hogan-Rochester over for the opening try in the fifth minute.

It proved only the briefest of blips, however, as England recovered and quickly stamped its authority on the match.

England hit back through its sharpest attacker, Ellie Kildunne, who scythed through four defenders to score a trademark try under the posts.

Three years ago, Kildunne scored in the third minute of the final as England raced into an early 14-0 lead, only to eventually lose 34-31 to New Zealand.

This time, however, England kept its foot on the throat and did not allow Canada, ranked second in the world, a sniff.

England turned to its driving maul to send Amy Cokayne over for a second try.

The third came via the strength of number eight Alex Matthews, appearing in her fourth World Cup final and, with Zoe Harrison converting all three tries, it was 21-8 at half-time.

It took 10 minutes of the second half for England to score its fourth try, with its relentless forward pack smashing a path for Abbie Ward to score.

Canada, with half its squad still semi-professional, showed terrific spirit as Hogan-Rochester got a second try and it enjoyed a spell camped on the England line.

England survived and finished strongly as Matthews scored a second try and the crowd were able to relax and roar their team home.

""It's frustrating for us because we know we didn't play our best game,"" Canada coach Kevin Rouet said.

""But I'm very proud of what they did, the sacrifice they made for three years just to get there.

""It was just missing 80 minutes of good rugby for us to be world champions.""

But getting him the last 700 or so kilometres to his final resting place, the Keppel Islands, is proving a hurdle to overcome due to finances and logistics.

As a member of the Woppaburra men's group, he's also a director of the Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreement (TUMRA).

The agreement covers the ancestral sea country of the Woppaburra people, including waters around Great Keppel Island, also known as Woppa.

Mr Morris has been working to get his grandfather home with the help of Sonny Van Issum, a fellow men's group member and operations manager of the Woppaburra TUMRA.

""He [our ancestor] would be lost and not know where to settle,"" Dr Van Issum said.

The Woppaburra people's grandfather is one of 1,785 ancestors who have been returned to Australia in the past 35 years from 10 countries.

The federal government said it was aware of at least 1,500 outstanding collections of remains kept in international institutions that it was working to have returned.

Dr Van Issum said although it was positive that more remains were being returned, his fight to put his ancestor to rest was an example of what many Indigenous groups around the country went through when navigating the final step in a complex process due to a lack of resources and funding.

""A lot of communities simply don't have the facilities to hold their old people or even the processes in place or the funds to bring them back to country,"" he said.

The journey home

According to Dr Van Issum, his ancestor's remains were likely taken sometime from the 1860s through to the early 1900s.

""It was common practice to remove a lot of our people, for research purposes or some quaint sort of a piece to put on the shelf for someone,"" he said.

The remains were given to the Queensland Museum, which then sent them to the United Kingdom in the 1930s where they were later blown up during the Blitz.

""They were then put into the Natural History Museum in London.""

He said other remains, of a Woppaburra woman, did not survive the bombing.

Though research determined the surviving man's remains to be Woppaburra in 2014, he was only returned earlier this year.

""We waited so long because the federal government wanted to have a number of ancestral remains all brought together at once for one large shipment rather than individuals,"" he said.

The remains of the ancestor were among 36 handed back to Australia in April at the Natural History Museum in London.

Final hurdle

The federal government can fund international repatriation, and the country's eight major museums can also apply for specific grant funding to retrieve remains, store them, and get them back to community.

Queensland Museum CEO Jim Thompson said the centre had more than 800 ancestral remains held under an ""in care by request"", on behalf of communities who were unable to house them locally.

Over the past 10 years, the museum has returned about 50 ancestors to communities.

Dr Van Issum, who is also on the museum's board, but not speaking on its behalf, said it was a complex, lengthy process and the funding was limited.

People like Mr Morris, in his volunteer position with the Woppaburra TUMRA, can also spend a lot of time finding the appropriate repatriation grants and applying for them.

The remaining Woppaburra people living on the islands were forcibly removed by 1902.

As a result, descendants today are geographically widespread.

Bringing them together for a proper cultural farewell on the islands is no easy feat and could cost tens of thousands of dollars.

He said although the prescribed body corporate had funds, the condition of the funding often meant it was strictly to be spent on certain activities or items, not including, in this case, repatriation.

""It's a tricky situation. But we're hoping that we're going to be able to secure some funding … we're not giving up,"" he said.

""We're also not going to rush this process or try and do it in a minimalist way.""","More First Nations remains are being returned to Australia from international institutions, but these Woppaburra men say laying them to rest on country can prove a fresh challenge.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/woppaburra-peoples-fight-to-get-ancestor-home/105788102,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/58ee252f8e2eeb0ca393aae659eb4f0d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2916&cropW=5184&xPos=0&yPos=245&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 20:58:19,Katrina Beavan,['Katrina Beavan'],en,,AU,-0.172
364062584,Prince Harry accuses insiders of ‘sabotaging reconciliation’ with King,"Prince Harry has suggested people are trying to “sabotage” his reconciliation with the King by casting their recent meeting in a negative light.

Father and son met on September 10 for the first time in 19 months. The brief private meeting, over tea at Clarence House, marked a thawing in relations and was widely considered a stepping stone on the path to rapprochement.

On Saturday (Sunday AEST) however, it was claimed that Harry, the Duke of Sussex, was “surprised by the formalities” of their reunion, which a source told The Sun was “awkward”.

364059014,Prime Minister Anthony Albanese meets King Charles at Balmoral Castle,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has met King Charles at Balmoral Castle after flying to Scotland for a private audience at the highlands estate.

Mr Albanese flew from London on Saturday morning with his fiancée, Jodie Haydon, for a meeting that had been arranged well in advance but kept largely under wraps until now.

The King welcomed Ms Haydon before shaking hands with the prime minister and giving him a warm smile.

Mr Albanese did not make any public comments following the meeting other than confirming it had taken place by sharing a photo on social media with a short message. “An honour to meet with you today, Your Majesty,” he wrote.

Mr Albanese had the meeting on his mind in recent days and mentioned it to leaders in London on Friday to underscore the significance of the trip.

“It will be quite a privilege to go up to Balmoral tomorrow, I’m looking forward to it,” he told Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch when they met at Stoke Lodge, the official residence of Australian High Commissioner Stephen Smith.

The formal audience with the head of state marked a break from days dominated by political and policy discussions during the Prime Minister’s overseas tour, which included visits to the United Nations in New York and meetings with leaders in London.

Some of those engagements are now subject to political criticism, after Opposition Leader Sussan Ley accused Mr Albanese of “swanning around” attending indulgent events like a summit of progressive political parties and their leaders in London on Friday.

Mr Albanese and Ms Haydon arrived on Saturday morning local time at the Royal Air Force base in Lossiemouth, where they were met with a traditional Scottish bagpipe welcome as they stepped onto the tarmac.

Strong winds across Scotland forced the Prime Minister’s Royal Australian Air Force jet to abort its initial landing approach, but it successfully touched down on the second attempt.

After greeting defence staff, they travelled through the countryside to Balmoral for the meeting with King Charles in the early afternoon.

Following their visit to Balmoral Castle, Mr Albanese and Ms Haydon went to the nearby Crathie Kirk church, where they met Reverend Kenneth Mackenzie and signed the guest book.

Crathie Kirk, a Church of Scotland church, is frequented by the royal family when staying at Balmoral.

King Charles has spent this week at Balmoral, the royal family’s retreat and a favourite residence of Queen Elizabeth, following a demanding schedule of diplomatic meetings including hosting US President Donald Trump last week during his state visit. The King continues to receive cancer treatment.

He hosted Mr Trump and Melania Trump at a royal banquet and arranged for them to be overnight guests at Windsor Castle.

In his address at the banquet, the King reminded Mr Trump of the importance of the AUKUS defence pact between the US, UK, and Australia, with the Pentagon is currently reviewing the agreement.

“Our AUKUS submarine partnership, with Australia, sets the benchmark for innovative and vital collaboration,” King Charles said.

These comments supported British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as well as Mr Albanese, who are working together to maintain momentum on AUKUS, showing the King’s unique influence.

Mr Albanese first met the King as Prime Minister during the London visit for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in September 2022 and again in May 2023 at the King’s coronation.

He also hosted the King and Queen in the Great Hall of Parliament House last October.",Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has met King Charles at Balmoral Castle after flying to Scotland for a private audience at the highlands estate.,https://thewest.com.au/news/royal-family/prime-minister-anthony-albanese-meets-king-charles-at-balmoral-castle-c-20165148,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20165148/d4f6dac8d7aa88aa54bf08afe4895e45af96d3db-16x9-x0y90w3000h1688.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-09-27 20:42:52,Kimberley Braddish,['Kimberley Braddish'],en,politics,au,0.101
364059476,Trump says he's sending troops to Portland to protect ICE facilities,"President Donald Trump said Saturday he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, a city he described as ""war ravaged,"" to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities he claimed are ""under siege"" by Antifa and ""other domestic terrorists.""

""At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists. I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,"" Trump wrote in a social media post.

The White House did not provide additional comment when reached by CNN for clarification on what the president meant by ""full force"" and which troops would be sent to the city.

It's the latest example of Trump's willingness to use the military in extraordinary ways as part of his push to reduce crime in American cities.

He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and to Washington, DC, last month.

He has also threatened to send troops to several other Democratic-led cities, such as Baltimore and Chicago.

Shortly after the president's post, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said on Fox News the Trump administration is investigating the ""highly organised"" nature of protests in certain American cities, claiming that some are being paid and funded.

There is no evidence of McLaughlin's claims.

""Whether it be in Portland, whether it be in Chicago or otherwise, we will bring the resources we need to make sure that Americans are safe,"" she added.

State and local leaders, including US Senator Jeff Merkley, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, US Representative Maxine Dexter and City Council members, urged the community to stay peaceful at a news conference on Friday night, according to CNN affiliate KPTV, after the city saw an increase in activity by federal agents.

""Here is what I do know – the president has sent agents here to create chaos and riots here in Portland, to induce a reaction. To induce protests. To induce conflicts. His goal is to make Portland look as he was describing it as,"" Merkley said.

""Our job is to say, 'We are not going to take the bait.'""

Wilson in a statement Saturday said there is no need to send troops, adding the president ""will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it.""

""Imagine if the federal government sent hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers to Portland, instead of a short, expensive, and fruitless show of force,"" the mayor wrote.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek wrote on social media Saturday her office had not been notified why the troops were being deployed.

""My office is reaching out to the White House and Homeland Security for more information. We have been provided no information on the reason or purpose of any military mission,"" Kotek wrote.

""There is no national security threat in Portland. Our communities are safe and calm.""

Trump's announcement comes after a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas by a gunman who investigators believe intended to target ICE personnel and property.

He killed one detainee and seriously injured two others.

An ICE facility about two miles (3.2 kilometres) south of downtown Portland has been at the centre of almost constant protests throughout the summer.

Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but some have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days over the summer.

Trump forecast action in Portland on Thursday, repeating the claim to reporters that protesters are being paid ""a lot of money"" to generate chaos.

""We're going to get out there, and we're gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that. They're professional agitators and anarchists,"" Trump said.

Trump earlier this month designated Antifa – the loose factions of black-clad leftists or anarchists who show up at protests opposing the police or government – as a ""major terrorist organization.""

The White House has emphasised incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the country to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.

Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officials were deployed to downtown Portland in 2020, during Trump's first term, due to protests after the murder of George Floyd.

""I'm going to look at it now, because I didn't know that was still going on. This has been going on for years,"" Trump said earlier this month.

364057970,Kelleher desperate to help Roosters complete unbeaten NRLW season,"Jocelyn Kelleher is relishing the chance to prove her credentials as the Sydney Roosters look to claim back-to-back NRLW premierships for the first time in their history.

Halfback Kelleher kicked the winning field goal three minutes from full-time in Gosford on Saturday night to clinch a 17-16 win over Cronulla and send the Roosters through to next Sunday's grand final.

The Roosters will meet the winners of Sunday's second preliminary final between Brisbane and Newcastle.

Kelleher, who is deputising in the number seven jersey following Tarryn Aiken's season-ending knee injury, is keen to stand tall when it matters most.

The 25-year-old, who usually plays five-eighth, nailed a pinpoint 40/30 kick along with her match-winning field goal.

Her grubber kicks also caused issues all night for the Sharks' scrambling defence.

""That was the best kick of my entire life, I've never hit it so straight before,"" Kelleher said.

""It was good to put some scenario stuff in place in case it does get down to the wire next week.

""We do a lot of that at training, and it came through out there.""

Kelleher said Roosters coach John Strange had given her the confidence to make the match-winning play.

""He has prepared us well for those situations, and it's good to see we can compete in high-pressure situations,"" she said.

""Hopefully, we'll bring that into next week.""

The win extended the Roosters' perfect record in 2025, with Strange's side unbeaten through 11 regular-season matches and Saturday's preliminary final victory over the Sharks.

Since the inception of the NRLW in 2018, only the Broncos (2018, 2020) have gone through the season undefeated, claimed the minor premiership and won the grand final.

Should they win next week's grand final, the Roosters would be the first side to complete the sweep since the competition expanded beyond four teams in 2021 to the current slate of 12 teams.

""That would be incredible. We put a lot of pressure on us to get better than last year,"" Kelleher said.

""We won last year, but that wasn't going to be good enough this year. We knew that.

364059016,Nick McCallum: Families still fighting for justice for the brutal murder of the ‘Balibo five’ in 1975,"It sends chills down my spine every time I see it.

A small, rundown, abandoned house with no roof, no doors, surrounded by grazing cattle on the road into Balibo in East Timor. It looks so inoffensive , so unremarkable now.

You brace yourself, walk inside and you can’t help it — your mind wanders back 50 years to the atrocity that occurred there. It’s the scene of the brutal murders of five young Australian TV journalists just doing their jobs.

Greg Shackleton, Gary Cunningham and Tony Stewart from Channel 7 in Melbourne and Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters from Channel 9 in Sydney were in Balibo to report on Indonesian incursions into the newly declared independent nation of East Timor.

They believed they would be treated as neutrals because they were from Australia, a “friendly neighbour” of Indonesia.

One of the last stories they got out of Balibo featured Greg Shackleton painting an Australian Flag on the building where they slept. In his report he said he hoped that would offer them “some protection.”

At dawn on October 16, 1975, from an old Portuguese Fort on a hill in the town they shot film of Indonesian special forces illegally invading the country. The Australians sprinted down the hill, scrambled into the house and locked the doors.

According to witnesses, Indonesian troops surrounded the house, forced their way in and stabbed and shot the five Australians. They then set a bonfire and burned the bodies and the film. It was a clinical, heartless, cold blooded massacre of neutral observers there to tell the world a story it should know .

The journalists had been invited to the small mountain village and escorted there by the-then Fretilin East Timor Government’s Foreign Affairs spokesman Jose Ramos-Horta.

He wanted the world to know Indonesia was illegally invading his country. He also wanted to force democracies like Australia to no longer ignore what was happening on its doorstep — to force the Government here to act — to pressure the United Nations to sanction and condemn Indonesia.

Ramos-Horta is now the President of East Timor. In an exclusive interview with 7 News he says the Indonesian explanation that the Australians were killed in crossfire is “absolute nonsense”.

He describes what happened as a “war crime , no doubt about it.”

But successive Australian Governments appeared to meekly accept the Indonesian explanation. And then when evidence of an atrocity became so overwhelming, they meekly pursued justice , giving up when it all became too hard .

International Politics Professor at Deakin University Damien Kingsbury says successive Australian Governments simply swept the issue under the carpet to maintain good relations with Indonesia , a bigger, more powerful neighbour.

We recently hosted family members of the “Balibo 5” in the new Channel 7 newsroom in Melbourne. In the entrance there is a memorial to their loved ones. Everyone who walks in can read their story of sacrifice and appreciate the dangers of journalism .

Even after 50 years seeing the photos of Greg, Gary and Tony on the wall brought tears to their eyes . Their pain, their anger never far from the surface .

The families have been fighting in vain for justice for five decades . They accuse successive Australian Governments of betrayal and are using the 50th anniversary to demand a formal parliamentary apology to the “Balibo 5 “ for the lack of support.

Sadly, there are no indications that will happen.

Professor Kingsbury says the stark truth is that their own Government thought these young men were “dispensable.”

Think about that.

How gut wrenching and infuriating is that for their families, their friends, their workmates and in fact all Australian journalists and broadcasters.

Where were the proud democratic principles, the tradition of fair go, the ethos of “standing by your mate when he’s in a fight” that we as a nation pride ourselves on?

The fight for justice for the Balibo Five must continue. We owe it to them and their families . We also owe it to all Australians so that none of us is ever considered “dispensable” again.",One of the last stories they got out of Balibo featured Greg Shackleton painting an Australian Flag on the building where they slept.

364055838,Russia’s foreign minister rejects having plans to attack NATO or EU,"Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned the NATO military alliance and the European Union that “any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response”.

As Russia’s war rages in Ukraine, tensions have mounted along NATO’s eastern flank in recent weeks as Estonia has accused the Kremlin of sending three fighter jets into its airspace and NATO jets shot down Russian drones in Polish airspace.

“Russia is being accused of almost planning to attack the North Atlantic Alliance and European Union countries. President (Vladimir) Putin has repeatedly debunked these provocations,” Lavrov told the United Nations General Assembly.

US President Donald Trump said this week that he endorsed the idea of shooting down Russian jets that violate NATO airspace, part of a rhetorical shift in which he appeared to mock Russia’s military performance in Ukraine and call it a paper tiger.

The United States also told the UN Security Council it would “defend every inch of NATO territory.”

Mr Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister for more than two decades, said his country was alarmed by remarks by some politicians in EU and NATO capitals of a looming World War III as a “likely scenario”.

They “openly discuss preparations for attacks on our territory in Kaliningrad and other Russian regions,” Mr Lavrov said.

“These figures are undermining any efforts to find a fair balance of interests among all of the members of the international community by trying to impose their unilateral approaches on everyone else,” Lavrov said.

Lavrov met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN General Assembly.

Ukrainian long-range drones hit an oil pumping station in Russia’s Chuvashia region, causing a fire and suspending its operations, a Ukrainian security official said on Saturday.

“The SBU (security service) continues to impose sanctions on the Russian oil sector, which brings the aggressor country excess profits that go to the war against Ukraine,” the official told Reuters.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that Israel had delivered a Patriot air defence system to his country and that it had been operational for the past month.

Speaking at a press conference, Mr Zelensky added that he expects two more systems to arrive in the coming weeks, without specifying their country of origin.

Ukraine relies heavily on foreign air defence systems to protect its cities from Russian attacks.

Mr Zelensky has repeatedly requested the US-made Patriot systems.

In May, the New York Times reported that a system stationed in Israel would be sent to Ukraine after undergoing refurbishment.

Official confirmation of the delivery came only on Saturday.

364061804,'The best and the worst in a day': Guy Sebastian reflects on court case with former manager,"In 2022, Guy Sebastian spent several days in court testifying against his former manager, Titus Day.

By night, he was performing on stage in front of a sea of fans.

""I'm going from the witness box and I would get on stage, and I would see fans in front of me,"" he tells ABC iview's The Assembly.

Sebastian became an instant pop star after winning the inaugural season of Australian Idol in 2003, going on to release 10 studio albums and win seven ARIA Music Awards.

Since then, he has represented Australia at Eurovision, placing fifth with his song Tonight Again in 2015, before going on to become a judge on X-Factor and The Voice.

He is also one of six, high-profile Australians interviewed by autistic journalism students on The Assembly.

In the interview, Sebastian opens up about the impact of the court case.

Day had been Sebastian's manager for more than a decade when the pair split over a financial dispute in 2017.

In 2022, a NSW District Court jury found Day guilty of misappropriating funds after embezzling more than $600,000 from the singer, but the convictions were quashed on appeal.

A retrial was ordered, and in July, a jury acquitted Day of four charges and remained hung on most of the allegations. The case was dismissed.

A civil trial between Sebastian and Day is expected to resume in the Federal Court. 

Sebastian says it was his song Before I Go that helped him navigate the tough time.

Sebastian sings: ""Just one more thing before I go / Before the final curtains close / There's no tellin' what comes next / But these tired hands will show / You'll know my name before I go.""

The 43-year-old said he was moved with every performance, standing on stage singing every word ""like I meant it"". 

""I just needed a bit of a reminder that no-one has power over me to decide how big I can dream or where I can go in life.""

Since the court case, Malaysian-born Sebastian says he has been intentional about where he directs his energy, particularly on social media.

""I remember I responded to a troll on social media, and someone said something awful to me, and I sent them a message back,"" Sebastian says.

""One of my fans wrote to me, and she said, 'Guy, I've sent you over 100 messages saying I love you and I support you … I've never had a response, yet this troll who doesn't follow you throws shade at you and gets your attention.'""

He says the encounter left him in tears.

""I almost felt this deep shame of where I was directing my energy, and our energy is precious. We only have a certain ... amount of it.

""I think it's a daily reminder to wake up and think, 'Am I going to devote my energy to the people who love me? Or am I going to waste it on people who aren't in my corner?'""

Becoming the first Australian Idol

It's been more than two decades since a 21-year-old Sebastian claimed the Australian Idol title, and a legion of loyal fans have stuck with him in the years since. 

He has been awarded multiple, publicly voted popular artist awards over his career and was recently inducted into the South Australian Music Hall of Fame.

But at the beginning — when he found himself in the 2003 Australian Idol final with Shannon Noll as his competition — Sebastian was surprised by his popularity.

""I came [to Australia] when I was six-and-a-half years old … and I was standing next to this sheep-shearing country boy that's singing country rock, had a Southern Cross tattoo.

""And at the time, I do remember there were people saying, 'Oh, Shannon's more the typical Aussie Idol'.""

Sebastian thought Noll was going to win ""by a long shot"".

""When you're listening to the noise of what people are saying a true Aussie is, it gets in your head a little bit,"" he said.

""[Then] suddenly, there were people wearing Afro wigs and camping outside my parents' house with 'go the fro' signs.

""It really did change my life.""

364061806,"Trump to deploy troops to 'war-ravaged' Portland, ICE facilities","US President Donald Trump says he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, ""authorising full force, if necessary"" to protect federal immigration facilities from ""domestic terrorists"" as he expands his controversial deployments to more American cities.

Portland, a Democratic-run city, is one of several so-called sanctuary cities. There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the term generally describes places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Mr Trump announced on social media on Saturday, local time, that he was directing the Department of Defense to ""provide all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland"".

It was necessary to protect ICE facilities, Mr Trump said, which he described as ""under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"".

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for details on Mr Trump's announcement, such as a timeline for the deployment or what troops would be involved.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, a Democrat, said there was no need for troops in his city.

""Our nation has a long memory of acts of oppression, and the president will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it,"" he said.

Early on Saturday, there was no sign of any federal presence in the city's downtown, where people jogged along the Willamette River, relaxed by a riverside fountain, or rode bikes on a sunny fall day.

""Where's the emergency?"" asked resident Allen Schmertzler, 72, who said he was ""disgusted"" by the president's decision.

Another resident, John McNeur, 74, called Mr Trump's statement ""ridiculous"". He pointed out that he was taking ""a leisurely stroll"" along the river on a peaceful, sunny day.

""This place is not a city that's out of control,"" he said. ""It's just a beautiful place.""

Mr Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago, but has yet to follow through.

A deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, is expected soon and will include only about 150 troops, far less than were sent to the District of Columbia for Mr Trump's crackdown on crime, or in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the troops' arrival. Mr Trump also sent Marines to Los Angeles.

Military ready to mobilise in 'calm' communities

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the Department of Defense would provide information and updates when available.

""We stand ready to mobilise US military personnel in support of DHS operations in Portland at the President's direction,"" Mr Parnell said.

But Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said there was ""no national security threat"" in Portland.

""Our communities are safe and calm,"" Ms Kotek said.

A spokesperson for the Oregon National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Bomar, said in an email that ""no official requests have been received at this time"" for Guard support. ""Any requests would need to be coordinated through the governor's office,"" he added.

Asked about the Portland decision on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents needed to be protected amid protests against immigration raids.

""We're not going to put up with it. This administration is not playing games,"" she said in an interview on Fox News.

There have been growing tensions in major US cities over Mr Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, days after a shooting targeting an ICE facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others seriously wounded.

Trump focuses on crime, 'antifa'

Since the September 10 assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Mr Trump has escalated his efforts to confront what he calls the ""radical left"", which he blames for the country's problems with political violence.

Mr Trump, in comments on Thursday in the Oval Office, suggested some kind of operation was in the works.

He said ""crazy people"" were trying to burn buildings in Portland.

""We're going to get out there and we're going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland,"" he said, describing them as ""professional agitators and anarchists"".

Mr Trump last week signed an executive order that declares the anti-fascist antifa movement a domestic ""terrorist organisation"" as part of a crackdown on what he claims is left-wing sponsored political violence.

According to US law enforcement, there has never been a terrorist incident in the United States connected to antifa.

Portland and protests

Mr Trump first sought to designate the movement as a domestic terror organisation during the nationwide George Floyd protests.

Portland, population 636,000, was also the site of long-running and sometimes violent racial justice protests following Mr Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police in 2020.

The Trump administration sent hundreds of agents, including from the US Border Patrol, for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

Recent protests have been far more muted and focused on the area around the ICE building, located outside the city's downtown, which was the heart of the 2020 protests. The building's main entrance and ground-floor windows have been boarded up and tagged with graffiti.

Earlier this month, the city said it would issue a land use violation notice to the city's ICE building because it had been used to detain people overnight or for more than 12 hours — violations of its conditional land use approval.

Early on Saturday, all was quiet outside that building, with no signs of protesters or law enforcement.

Some federal agents have been injured, and several protesters have been charged with assault. Some demonstrators also say they've been injured. When protesters erected a prop guillotine earlier this month, the DHS described it as ""unhinged behaviour"".

In the meantime, city groups and officials have sought to highlight the recovery of the downtown area since 2020.

This summer was reportedly the busiest for pedestrian traffic since before the coronavirus pandemic, and overall violent crime in Portland from January through June decreased by 17 per cent compared to the same period in 2024, a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found.

The downtown has seen a decrease in homeless encampments that defined the years immediately after the pandemic.","The military says it is ready to mobilise as Donald Trump authorises ""full force"" to protect federal immigration facilities from ""domestic terrorists"".",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-28/trump-orders-deployment-of-troops-to-portland-ice-facilities/105825548,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9a95cc57768e812ad7ddee14c4317d21?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485,,2025-09-27 20:22:16,ABC News,['ABC News'],en,politics,AU,-0.228
364061914,Women’s World Cup: India romp to victory over NZ; Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka in last ball,"Bengaluru, Sep 28 (IANS) India romped to a commanding victory over New Zealand while Bangladesh claimed a final-ball win over Sri Lanka in warm-up matches ahead of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025, to be held in India and Sri Lanka from September 30.

India sealed a commanding 4-wicket win (DLS Method) against New Zealand in their second warm-up clash as they finalised preparation for the tournament opener against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, September 30, in Guwahati.

Chasing 237 for the win to bounce back after a heavy loss against England, and despite a strong start, India stumbled at the beginning.

An attacking start saw India speed through to 54/0 at the end of the eighth over, before Jess Kerr castled Pratika Rawal to bring New Zealand’s first wicket of the game. Uma Chetry kept going but eventually fell for 38 to leave India in a tricky situation at 71/2.

Harleen Deol and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur went on to steady the ship for India, with both batters reaching their respective half-centuries, amassing 74 and 69 respectively to power India through in the chase in the middle overs. The duo added 132 runs for the third wicket to push India towards safety.

Bree Illing and Jess Kerr struck at the death with two quick wickets of Jemimah Rodrigues and the Indian skipper, but India eventually survived the scare and sealed the deal with ten balls to spare.

Earlier, New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine won the toss and chose to bat first in a match where play began after a rain delay.

India struck early with two quick wickets, reducing New Zealand to 38/2 in the eighth over. Skipper Sophie Devine and Melie Kerr steadied the innings with a strong partnership, keeping the scoreboard moving even through another rain delay. Devine brought up a well-crafted half-century, while Kerr was dismissed for 40 on the first ball of the 25th over. At the halfway mark, New Zealand were at 132/3.

New Zealand took on India A in their first warm-up game, posting a strong total of 273 in the first innings, highlighted by a brilliant unbeaten century from Izzy Gaze. However, India A secured victory by the DLS method, reaching 226/6 in 39.3 overs before rain interrupted play.

India, on the other hand, endured a disappointing outing in their first warm-up game. England posted a massive total of 339, and despite a strong start, India faltered in the run chase, ultimately falling short by 152 runs.

Bangladesh win thriller

Bangladesh held their nerve to seal a nail-biting win over Sri Lanka by a single run in their warm-up fixture just before the World Cup kicks off on September 30.

It proved to be the ideal hit out after their respective warm-ups were called off due to rain, with fewer than 10 overs played two days ago.

Despite a faltering start where the Sri Lankan scorecard fell from 56/1 to 86.4, Kaveesha Dilhari and Nilakshika Silva held their guard to post commanding half-centuries and guide Sri Lanka in the chase.

Dilhari’s anchoring 63-run knock came to an unfortunate end when the bat slipped off her hand and hit the stumps following a good shot over mid-wicket. Despite the blow, Silva kept going, helping herself to 75 off 78 before falling in the penultimate over.

Marufa Akter sealed the win off the final over by defending nine runs, with able help from Nahida Akter, whose 3-28 from her 10 overs changed the course of the game.

Earlier, after Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat first, Sri Lanka got off to a solid start when a beautiful inswinging delivery from Udeshika Prabodhani dismissed Farzana Haque on the first ball of the second over.

However, Rubya Haider and Sharmin Akter steadied the innings, putting together a 90-run partnership. Kaveesha Dilhari then struck for Sri Lanka, claiming the wickets of Rubya Haider and Sobhana Mostary in quick succession.

After the halfway stage, the Sri Lankan bowlers kept things tight, never allowing Bangladesh to build big partnerships and striking at regular intervals. Dewmi Vihanga, Malki Madara, and Kaveesha Dilhari stood out with the ball, each picking up two wickets.

Sri Lanka managed to restrict Bangladesh to 242/8, who managed the total thanks to Sharmin Akter’s 71.

Both teams’ next assignment will be at the World Cup, where Sri Lanka will take on India in the tournament opener in Guwahati on September 30, while Bangladesh face Pakistan in Colombo on October 2 in their first game.","Bengaluru, Sep 28 (IANS) India romped to a commanding victory over New Zealand while Bangladesh claimed a final-ball win over Sri Lanka in warm-up matches ahead of the ICC Women’s&#8230; Continue reading Women&#8217;s World Cup: India romp to victory over NZ; Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka in last ball

364054718,Trump orders troops into ‘war-ravaged’ city,"Mr Trump confirmed in his Saturday announcement that he is “authorising full force, if necessary,” amid a spate of daily protests against the federal ICE detention facility in Portland that have intensified since June.

“At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,” Mr Trump declared on Truth Social.

“I am also authorising Full Force, if necessary.”

The deployment in Portland - the largest city in Oregon - would follow similar moves by the Republican president to mobilise troops against the wishes of local Democratic leadership in Los Angeles and the capital Washington.

Portland has seen months of protests at a local ICE facility amid anger over the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented migrants.

The city was also the scene of major clashes during Mr Trump’s first term, at the height of racial justice protests following the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd.

Protests have occurred at other ICE facilities around the country as Mr Trump’s mass deportation drive has seen thousands of migrants rounded up, often by masked agents.

The hardline approach has sparked conflict with local so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions like Portland, which have policies of not coordinating with federal immigration authorities.

Mr Trump first deployed troops in Los Angeles in June, overriding the state’s Democratic governor and prompting an ongoing legal dispute over the limits of presidential authority.

Mr Trump’s announcement Saturday comes days after a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Texas, in which one detainee was killed and two severely injured.

Federal officials say the gunman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, had sought to target ICE agents from a nearby rooftop.

That shooting happened weeks after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university campus.

Following Mr Kirk’s assassination, Mr Trump announced that he was labeling the diffuse left-wing “Antifa” movement as a “domestic terrorist group.” The designation has led to worries among Trump’s critics that it could be used to broadly suppress dissent in the name of national security.

“We are witnessing domestic terrorist sedition against the federal government,” Mr Trump’s top aide, Stephen Miller, wrote Friday evening on X.

“All necessary resources will be utilized,” he added.

Ms Bondi announced Friday evening that the Justice Department would deploy agents to ICE facilities across the country. The Joint Terrorism Task Forces will investigate “domestic terrorism,” and seek the “most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs,” the attorney general wrote on X.

364059474,Albanese joins UK PM in far right warnings as he takes Aussie beers to No.10,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has joined the British Prime Minister in his warnings over the dangers posed by far-right political parties.

It comes as Sir Keir Starmer cracks down on illegal migrants with immigration increasingly a lightning rod for criticism in Europe.

The British Prime Minister hosted his Australian counterpart at Number 10.

READ MORE: Investigation as bodies of woman, 61, and man in his 60s found in NSW home﻿

Starmer said the topics of discussion included defence, security, trade and the economy.

Albanese said: ""We share values and today more so than ever really.""

Later, he was seen heading into the famous door with some Aussie-brewed beers with partner Jodie Haydon.

He clutched a four-pack of his own Albo brew by Willie The Boatman﻿ in Sydney.

Albanese and Starmer are both from the progressive side of politics.

Albanese scored a thumping re-election in May.

The other is facing an early reckoning just 14 months after winning power.

The British public is increasingly concerned about illegal migrants, with many crossing the English Channel in boats.

The British PM has announced a mandatory digital ID in a bid to stamp out illegal workers.

The PM declined to say whether he recommended Sir Keir learn the lesson of the Australian Labor Party and muscle up in border control.

Although the two leaders did discuss defence of another kind, Starmer and Albanese's main mission is to protect the AUKUS pact from being unpicked by Donald Trump's America First agenda but they're also both alarmed by the rise of the far right and how this is threatening politics as we know it.

The US President's unique brand of populism has been matched in Britain by Nigel Farage's Reform party which is leading the UK polls.

Farage is riding a wave of anti-immigration sentiment helped along by rallies stoked by far-right activists.

March for Australia protests have also been held in major cities over the past few weeks.﻿

""That sends shivers through the spines on many of our communities,"" Starmer said.

""I don't want to see the rise of populist organisations,"" Albanese added.

364059010,"Artificial intelligence could change face of hip dysplasia diagnosis, reduce clinician workload","Artificial intelligence is on par with medical experts in diagnosing hip dysplasia in children — and can do it 30 times faster.

Those are the findings from new research conducted by Perth medical experts, and it could soon transform the diagnostic landscape for healthcare workers.

About one in 100 infants worldwide are affected by hip dysplasia, an instability of the hip or hip socket which can cause dislocation.

Delayed diagnosis can lead to chronic low-back pain, early degenerative joint disease or arthritis, which can lead to total hip replacement early in life.

University of Western Australia and Child and Adolescent Health Service researchers Chandra Rath and Suketu Bhavsar undertook a review of 23 studies that used AI to interpret more than 15,000 medical images of children from birth to 10-years-old.

Their research, published in the Royal Australasian College of Physicians’ Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health, found that not only is AI is on par with the diagnostic accuracy of clinical experts, it can also make its diagnoses 30 times faster.

The promising technology could have a range of benefits, including early detection and treatment to prevent long-term joint problems or major surgery later in life.

It could also save new parents multiple appointments and trips to the hospital, and improve access to early screening, particularly in countries or remote areas where specialists are in short supply.

“We are hoping to see this in hospitals in the next five years,” Dr Rath said.

Dr Rath and Dr Bhavsar, both neonatologists, said “artificial intelligence offers significant potential to automate manual tasks, ensure service consistency, and improve patient care”.

“Most important is that images can be obtained with little training,” Dr Rath said.

“If a junior doctor with less training or a nurse or midwife can take good images . . . radiologists will be left with much less volume of work.”

With the World Health Organisation projecting a shortage of 11 million health workers by 2030, it’s this task shifting that could mitigate barriers to healthcare in low- and middle-income countries, where there is already a shortage of specialised workers and high costs associated with diagnosis.

“We’re talking here about not replacing health systems, but a partnership with AI,” Dr Bhavsar said.

“With the speed and consistency of AI and the diagnostic acumen of physicians, we can make the system more effective, faster.”

The researchers are acutely aware, however, of the obstacles facing the burgeoning field of diagnostic AI.

“AI is not going to come without challenges, it’s still new for everyone,” Dr Bhavsar said.

Poor quality ultrasound or x-ray images or different imaging angles could reduce accuracy, and patient diversity must be taken into account.

“We need to train the AI with vast and diverse populations,” Dr Bhavsar said.

“AI can also be trained with blurry images, reversed images or noisy images . . . (so it) can be more reliable when we apply it in other settings.”

But before use in any clinical settings, it will go through rigorous testing and optimisation to ensure it can deliver expert-level accuracy and help clinicians increase diagnostic efficiency while reducing workloads.","Artificial intelligence is on par with medical experts in diagnosing hip dysplasia in children, and can do it 30 times faster. ",https://thewest.com.au/news/health/artificial-intelligence-could-change-face-of-hip-dysplasia-diagnosis-reduce-clinician-workload-c-20148606,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20148606/52f79c8e26944ee0c7eb098be9a239eca53ca19a-16x9-x0y138w1523h857.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-09-27 20:00:00,Hannah Cross,['Hannah Cross'],en,politics,au,-0.027

Nobel also stipulated that “no consideration be given to nationality, but that the [prizes] be awarded to the worthiest person, whether or not they are Scandinavian”.

The prize for economics was added in 1968, funded in perpetuity by Sweden’s central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, “in memory of” Alfred Nobel. It is treated as equal to Nobel’s original five and carries the same prize money.

You can’t nominate yourself for a Nobel, and you shouldn’t reveal who you’ve nominated (even if some do). For physics, for example, nominations are sought from members of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, members of the Nobel Committee for Physics, previous physics laureates, tenured professors at a select group of universities and “other scientists from whom the Academy may see fit to invite proposals”. Recipients must be alive when their award is announced (though the organisation once made an exception for a winner who, unbeknownst to them, had died just beforehand).

A prize can’t be revoked once awarded. No appeals can be made. Even if you refuse to accept the prize, as did Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho in 1973 and the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1964 (who believed the prize would compromise his work), you are still listed as having won. “The fact that he has declined this distinction does not in the least modify the validity of the award,” sniffed the awarding panel of the Sartre controversy).

This year, laureates will be announced on October 6 for medicine, October 7 for physics, October 8 for chemistry, October 9 for literature, October 10 for the peace prize, and October 13 for the economics prize. Winners are expected to attend the awards ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death.

What’s the best way to win a Nobel?

The British microbiologist Richard J. Roberts did not make a promising start to a career in science, finding school so boring he failed his physics “A” Level (the UK’s school-leaving exam) and had to repeat his final year. At university, though, he found his way into biology and went on to make important discoveries in the world of RNA, the “messenger” within DNA that makes sure instructions are carried out within cells.

In 1993, he shared the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine with the American biologist Phillip A. Sharp (another slightly unusual winner who had grown up on a farm in Kentucky and saved for college tuition by raising cattle and growing tobacco). Much later, Roberts was asked by an academic journal for his top 10 tips on how to win a Nobel in one of the fields of science.

Only if you are extraordinarily lucky will you stand any chance of winning a Nobel Prize

Rule No.1, he wrote: Don’t hope or even think about it. “If you are successful in your research career, then you will make lots of discoveries and have a very happy life. If you are lucky, you will make a big discovery that may even bag you a prize or two. But only if you are extraordinarily lucky will you stand any chance of winning a Nobel prize. They are very elusive.”

His other tips include: collaborate (but with no more than two others, since the prizes can only be shared among three people, see above); be nice to Swedish scientists (who may have influence with the Nobel organisation); work in the laboratories of past or potential future Nobel-winners; already have won once (which seems to increase your chances of getting a second), study biology, which offers many opportunities for discovery (“we still know relatively little about it”); and, critically, don’t plan your life around your Nobel prospects. “This has proven disastrous for many people. I know several scientists who became convinced that they were going to win and had all sorts of plans for less-than-modest speeches acknowledging the award of the prize, preparing comments for journalists and planning subsequent trips to exotic places to talk about their discovery. ”

The science journal Nature, which analysed Nobel-winning trends, added that your chances are improved by working in the US, where most Nobel laureates have been based (as was Brian Schmidt) and by specialising in particle physics, cell biology or atomic physics (the top three scientific fields with the most Nobels). That’s partly because the US has attracted scientific talent from across the planet, says Peter Doherty, “A situation that has now changed with the attack on science by the current US administration.”

Comparatively few laureates have been women, Marie Curie the only one to win twice. Before 1970, only three women had won the peace prize, which until then was largely the preserve of “highly educated white men from Europe and the United States”, as the Nobel organisation admits today. There are still only 19 women peace-prize winners (among them Mother Teresa, 1979, and Malala Yousafzai in 2014, who at 17 became the prize’s youngest winner, for advocating for girls’ education) compared with more than 90 men.

“This reflects the continuing systemic exclusion and marginalisation that has kept women from positions of power, visibility, and recognition in peacebuilding and diplomacy,” reflects Jody Williams, who was just the 10th woman to win the peace prize, in 1997. “Never mind that we know women don’t start wars, that when women are involved in peace processes they are more inclusive and longer lasting, and that women are the ones holding communities and lives together while wars waged by men cause death and destruction.”

And despite Alfred Nobel’s notion that the prizes should recognise achievements from the previous year, you’re extremely unlikely to win a science prize, in particular, within even a decade or two of your breakthrough research, a delay we might dub “Nobel lag”.

There’s a logjam of worthy contenders ahead of you in the Nobel queue lining up to be recognised; and the Nobel organisation is keen to make sure your discovery is both correct (some have turned out not to be) and of long-lasting value to humanity. Science in particular can take a lot of time, notes astronomer Brian Keating in his book Losing the Nobel Prize. “Decade-long experimental searches are common. Decades more are sometimes required to vet, and to replicate, the discoveries.”

To wit: Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura, the trio responsible for designing the first blue LED light that could be used commercially, in 1993, had to wait until 2014 for their prizes. (Blue LED combines with red and yellow LEDs to make white light and today is used in everything from TVs to energy-efficient lightbulbs to smartphones.) Schmidt, in Australia, and Perlmutter and Riess in the US, made their discoveries around 1998 but had to wait until 2011 for the shared Nobel. Doherty and his co-winner claimed theirs in 1996 for a discovery published in 1974. “We got it 22 years out, and that’s absolutely average.”

Why are they sometimes controversial?

The Nobels have occasionally gone awry. There have been instances of women being passed over for their undeserving male colleagues or bosses, awards given for research that was later found to be bunk (notably, Danish physician Johannes Fibiger’s Nobel for research into cancer in rats, which was later proven completely false), Nobels clumsily awarded to make good for previous oversights, and Nobels given off the back of what was arguably somebody else’s earlier work. One laureate tells us the Nobels celebrated another researcher who had appropriated their findings wholesale. “Basically, there’s not much you can do about it,” they tell us. “He was an asshole.” (The Nobel Foundation eventually made good for our laureate with a subsequent prize many years later.)

Albert Einstein, who should surely have won the prize for physics several times, was only awarded it once, in 1922, for one of his lesser-known discoveries, the omissions reportedly because he had an enemy on the Nobel committee who thought Einstein’s theories just didn’t jibe with common sense … which of course they didn’t. Gandhi, for his part, was probably technically not eligible given that Nobel dictated the peace prize must be awarded “for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses” – but one imagines today the organisation might have conjured up a loophole.

Literature prizes are always subjective to some degree, says Peter Doherty, who has attended several award ceremonies as a consequence of being an invited speaker at pre-Nobel events. There’s a long line of winners most people had never heard of, writing in languages that the Nobel judges couldn’t understand, while Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Henrik Ibsen, Joseph Conrad and Virginia Woolf are among the numerous luminaries who have missed out.

But it’s the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded by a committee appointed by the Norwegian parliament, that can ruffle feathers most, says Doherty. “They’re frequently highly political because they’re trying to influence affairs, and sometimes they get things wrong. I mean, they should never have given one to Obama.” A former secretary of the Peace Prize committee, Geir Lundestad, would later write that the intention of the prize had been to strengthen Obama’s resolve, which had probably been misguided – a case of aspiration rather than achievement. “Even many of Obama’s supporters believed that the prize was a mistake,” he wrote. Obama himself acknowledged some discomfort at winning in a press conference he gave in the White House Rose Garden. “To be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who’ve been honoured by this prize, men and women who’ve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.”

As for the current president, “For nearly a decade, Mr Trump has publicly and privately complained that he has yet to win the prestigious prize,” notes The New York Times. ”He has mentioned the award dozens of times in interviews, speeches and campaign rallies dating back to his first term.”

If Trump was nominated before the February 1 deadline, he may yet be a chance. It’s understood the Norwegian Nobel Institute will not only consider his past achievements but anything noteworthy between his nomination and when they make the final decision, probably in early October, according to its director, Olav Njølstad.

But maybe Trump shouldn’t worry so much about winning one anyway. “Lots of people don’t really know what a Nobel prize is,” the economics laureate David Card tells us. “I took a taxi to an event when I won the prize and my wife proudly told the driver where we were going, but he had no knowledge of Nobel prizes. After that we decided to keep it to ourselves.”

It’s understood the Norwegian Nobel Institute will not only consider his past achievements but anything noteworthy between his nomination and when they make the final decision, probably in early October, according to its director, Olav Njølstad.

But maybe Trump shouldn’t worry so much about winning one anyway. “Lots of people don’t really know what a Nobel prize is,” the economics laureate David Card tells us. “I took a taxi to an event when I won the prize and my wife proudly told the driver where we were going, but he had no knowledge of Nobel prizes. After that we decided to keep it to ourselves.”

364061912,Nepal stun West Indies for historic first win in T20I over a full member,"Sharjah, Sep 28 (IANS) Nepal made international T20 history on Saturday by defeating the West Indies by 19 runs in the first match of the three-match T20I series, registering their first win against a full-member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).

With their bowlers striking blows at regular intervals against a West Indies side which was without some of its big guns, Nepal surged to a historic 19-run victory. As a result, Nepal took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, with the second T20I scheduled for September 29.

In a match played at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, the West Indies won the toss and elected to field first against the Associate Member team. They restricted Nepal to a modest score of 148/8, which the side from the Himalayas compiled riding on vital contributions by their middle order.

After West Indies pacers Akeal Hosain sent back Kushal Bhurtel (5) and Jason Holder accounted for Aasif Sheikh (3) to reduce Nepal to 12/2 in the fourth over, skipper Rohit Paudel (38 off 35 balls), Kusal Malla (30 from 21), and Gulsan Jha (22 off 16) helped them reach 148/8 despite another late order collapse triggered by leggie Navin Bidaisee, who accounted for Paudel and Malla in successive overs.

For the West Indies, Holder claimed 4-20 while Bidaisee bagged 3-29.

Chasing 149, West Indies lost Kyle Mayers for five runs, run out by Kushal Bhurtel. The West Indies could never get going and lost wickets at regular intervals as Amir Jangoo (19 off 22), Ackeem Auguste (15 off 7), Keacy Carty (16 off 15), and Navin Bidaisee (22 off 25) couldn’t score big.

Despite some lower-order efforts from Fabian Allen (19 off 14) and captain Akeal Hosein (18 off 9), West Indies could manage only 129/9, handing Nepal a memorable 19-run victory.

Brief scores:

Nepal 148/8 in 20 overs (Rohit Paudel 38, Kushal Malla 30, Gulsan Jha 22; Jason Holder 4-20, Navin Badaisee 3-29) beat West Indies 129/9 in 20 overs (Navin Badaisee 22, Amir Jangoo 19; Kushal Bhurtel 2-17) by 19 runs.","Sharjah, Sep 28 (IANS) Nepal made international T20 history on Saturday by defeating the West Indies by 19 runs in the first match of the three-match T20I series, registering their&#8230; Continue reading Nepal stun West Indies for historic first win in T20I over a full member

364048170,Albo meets King Charles at Balmoral Castle,"The Australian prime minister flew from London to the Scottish Highlands to meet the monarch on the second full day of his visit to the UK.

He was greeted by a Scottish bagpiper and a rousing rendition of Scotland The Brave as he arrived at the military airport of Lossiemouth in northern Scotland for the highly anticipated meeting on Saturday.

Mr Albanese and his partner, Jodie Haydon, presented the king with a framed photo of his visit to Australia with Queen Camilla in October 2024.

The royals can be seen in the picture signing the visitor’s book at Parliament House in Canberra. 

The Prime Minister later posted a photo os his Balmoral meeting on social media with the caption: “An honour to meet with you today, Your Majesty.”

It was his fourth audience with the British monarch and followed the king’s visit to Australia in October last year.

Mr Albanese had also previously met the king in London when he attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022 and visited for the king’s coronation in May 2023.

Mr Albanese will go to Liverpool for the Labour Party’s annual conference on Sunday.

On Friday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a global conference of centre-left leaders Friday that they must tackle uncontrolled migration and confront “lies” being told about their countries by hard-right politicians seeking to win over voters.

The meeting in London included Mr Albanese and Canadian premier Mark Carney and comes as right-wing populism rises around the world and with Republican Donald Trump back in the White House.

“I don’t accept that argument that somehow our politics is dying out,” said Starmer, noting his landslide election win in July 2024 and the more recent victories of Carney and Albanese.

“But I do accept that it is now time for social democrats to confront directly some of the challenges and some of the lies, frankly, that have taken root in our societies,” he added.

Mr Starmer’s Labour Party has fallen behind the anti-immigrant Reform UK party in national polls since he secured a landslide general election victory in July last year.

The British leader’s speech saw him try to lay out a more optimistic view of the future than the one put forward by Reform, headed by anti-European Union firebrand Nigel Farage.

Farage, a supporter of Trump, regularly claims that Britain is “broken” and Starmer has started to accuse him of being unpatriotic as he tries to claw back support.

The UK PM told the conference that Britain’s next general election, expected in 2029, would be a “battle for the soul of the country” and a straight fight between Labour and Reform.

He said the “defining political choice of our times” was between “a politics of predatory grievance” or one of “patriotic renewal”.",Anthony Albanese has met with King Charles for a private audience in Scotland.,https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/royals/anthony-albanese-meets-king-charles-at-balmoral/news-story/1f6cbbea60237cc5785d8d8b2eadb73d?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/1bf3d05f79698d24386d3da211580bc4,,2025-09-27 19:36:36,Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp,['Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp'],en,entertainment,au,0.176

Now this Australian classic is hitting the stage,"When The Shiralee was broadcast in 1988, it was an old-school miniseries that these days would be called a “TV event”.

Mulvany’s dad, Danny, was a 10-pound Pom from England and a Vietnam veteran who worked for the Main Roads Department. The pair would talk about soil and rocks and pick up injured animals as they travelled around the Kimberley and the Pilbara.
