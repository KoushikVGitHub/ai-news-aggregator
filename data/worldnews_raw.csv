365840296,"Second phase of Sabar Dairy will open new job avenues, says Haryana CM","Rohtak, Oct 3 (IANS) Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Friday said the second phase of the Sabar Dairy will not only help meet the growing dairy demand of northern India but also open new avenues of employment. 

The Chief Minister said this while addressing the gathering on the occasion of the inauguration of the second phase of the Sabar Dairy (Amul plant) by Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah here.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of ‘Sahkar se Samriddhi’ (prosperity through cooperation) has infused fresh energy into India’s cooperative movement.

“The establishment of the Ministry of Cooperation in 2021 reflected this vision,” he said, adding that the National Cooperation Policy, 2025, is one of its major achievements.

The Chief Minister said, “Amul is not merely a brand of milk and dairy products; it represents the strength of India’s cooperative movement.”

The modern plant in Rohtak will cater to the dairy requirements of Delhi-NCR and northern India while giving a significant boost to Haryana’s rural economy.

CM Saini said the plant, which first became operational in January 2015, has now undergone an expansion with an outlay of Rs 325 crore.

Following this expansion, it has emerged as the largest facility in the country for producing curd, buttermilk and yoghurt.

The Chief Minister further said the expanded unit will ensure better prices for farmers and create thousands of employment opportunities for the youth.

He said the state government is extending low-interest loans to farmers through cooperative societies.

“HAFED is supplying high-quality seeds, fertilisers and pesticides on time, while the sugar federation is paying sugarcane farmers Rs 400 per quintal and is operating six cooperative sugar mills across the state.”

CM Saini said the state ranked third nationally in milk production, with per capita availability at 1,105 grams per day and annual production touching 122.2 lakh tonnes.

Through cooperative dairy societies, producers have been receiving benefits under the Accident Insurance Scheme since 2015. In 2023-24, the insurance cover was raised to Rs 10 lakh, he said.","Rohtak, Oct 3 (IANS) Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Friday said the second phase of the Sabar Dairy will not only help meet the growing dairy demand of&#8230; Continue reading Second phase of Sabar Dairy will open new job avenues, says Haryana CM

365840282,Man’s body exhumed in Greater Noida 30 days after death on suspicion of murder,"Greater Noida, Oct 3 (IANS) The death of a 23-year-old man in Dankaur area in Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida has taken a dramatic turn after police exhumed his body nearly a month afterwards, amid growing suspicion that he was murdered.

The deceased, identified as Shahzad, a resident of Dankaur, was found dead on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on September 3.

At that time, police reached the spot after getting information from locals, and the death was assumed to be the result of a road accident.

Believing the same, Shahzad’s family performed his last rites without a post-mortem examination and buried his body.

However, doubts began to surface a few days later. The family alleged that Shahzad had an altercation with a group of youths from a neighbouring village during a local fair in August.

They claimed the rivalry may have escalated into a planned murder, with the assailants staging the scene to make it appear as a road accident.

Acting on the family’s complaint, police sought a magistrate’s order to exhume the body.

On Friday, the body was dug up in the presence of a medical team and sent for a post-mortem examination to determine the actual cause of death.

“The case is being investigated from all possible angles. Further action will be taken once the post-mortem report is available,” a senior police officer said, adding that the matter has become highly sensitive in the area.

The incident has become a topic of discussion in the locality, with residents demanding a fair probe to uncover the truth behind Shahzad’s death.

Police have intensified the investigation and are examining possible enmity as well as circumstantial evidence around the incident.

The post-mortem report is expected to play a decisive role in shaping the case.","Greater Noida, Oct 3 (IANS) The death of a 23-year-old man in Dankaur area in Uttar Pradesh&#8217;s Greater Noida has taken a dramatic turn after police exhumed his body nearly&#8230; Continue reading Man’s body exhumed in Greater Noida 30 days after death on suspicion of murder

365840278,‘Will wipe out Pakistan if it does not stop terrorism’: Army Chief,"Jaipur, Oct 3 (IANS) In a strong message to Pakistan, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi said on Friday that India would no longer exercise the restraint it had shown during Operation Sindoor, and would wipe out Pakistan if the neighbouring country does not stop cross-border terrorism.

“We will wipe out Pakistan from the face of the earth if they don’t stop terrorism. Be prepared, God willing, the opportunity will come soon,” the Army Chief declared while addressing soldiers at the Army cantonment in village 22 MD, Ghadsana, Sriganganagar.

“Our next response would be decisive and far more destructive against Pakistan,” he warned. 

The Army Chief said Pakistan must give up its policy of supporting terrorism if it wants to ensure its survival in the international community. 

“This time, India will take such strong action that Pakistan will have to reconsider whether it wants to remain on this geographical map,” he added.

Terming Operation Sindoor a turning point, General Dwivedi recalled that Operation Sindoor was launched after the Pahalgam terror attack. 

“The Indian Army destroyed nine Pakistani terror hideouts during the operation, killing over 100 terrorists. Seven targets were destroyed by the Army and two by the Air Force,” he said. 

The Army Chief said that the operation, named by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and dedicated to women, would remain etched in the memory of the armed forces. 

“Operation Sindoor has become such an integral part of our lives that it will stay with us forever,” he said.

The Army Chief pointed out that the entire world had condemned the Pahalgam attack and stood with India. 

“We showed clear evidence of the destroyed terror camps to the world. If we had not done so, Pakistan would have hidden the truth,” he noted, stressing that this time India was fully prepared.

General Dwivedi also honoured three officers for their role in Operation Sindoor, including Commandant Prabhakar Singh, 140th Battalion, BSF, Major Ritesh Kumar, Rajputana Rifles and Havildar Mohit Gera. 

“These men represent the courage and determination of the Indian Armed Forces,” the Army Chief said, urging soldiers to stay ready for future challenges.","Jaipur, Oct 3 (IANS) In a strong message to Pakistan, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi said on Friday that India would no longer exercise the restraint it had shown during&#8230; Continue reading ‘Will wipe out Pakistan if it does not stop terrorism’: Army Chief

365835234,New plan to fix cash in transit crisis,"Armaguard received a $50m bailout last year from Australia’s big four banks – ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac – and four of the largest retailers in Wesfarmers, Coles, Woolworths and Australia Post to help the cash transport distributor stay in business.

Australia’s only cash-in-transit service struggled to stay afloat after consumers opted to use digital payments over cash seeing Armguard’s revenue decline.

Deloitte Access Economics provided its final independent pricing mechanism report to Armaguard and Australia’s major banks and retailers.The model requires approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission before it can be adopted.

A Deloitte spokesman said it was an important milestone to keep cash available around Australia, even when people used less.

“(It) would support the continued financial viability of cash distribution across Australia, especially in regional and remote areas,” the spokesman said.

“All parties have worked together in good faith to achieve this milestone and will continue to work together to ensure the ongoing sustainability of cash-in-transit services.”",Deloitte’s has recommended a new pricing model to fix Armaguard’s cash-in-transit pricing model to keep cash flowing around Australia.,https://www.news.com.au/finance/deloittes-develops-plan-to-fix-armaguards-cashintransit-pricing-model-and-keep-cash-flowing-around-australia/news-story/dc3e3909cc7e674b7bdcf22fb1d3003c?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a199097b66f124e0835c00007d4ee64d,,2025-10-03 11:47:57,Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp,['Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp'],en,au,-0.286,
365835232,Ley’s leadership threat as star recruit quits,"The Western Australian MP, 42, is regarded as a potential future leader of the Liberal Party. 

He had previously indicated he would quit or be dumped from the shadow cabinet if the Coalition did not abandon the target of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

But it has now emerged that the immigration issue was the trigger for him to quit the frontbench with high profile backbenchers Jacinta Price and Jane Hume. 

“The leader has made it clear that the Shadow Home Affairs Minister won’t lead the Coalition’s response to immigration matters or develop the Coalition’s immigration strategy,” he said in a statement on Friday evening.

“On this basis, I made the decision that I was not able to continue in this role and remain silent on immigration.

“It is a well-established standard in the Westminster system that, if a member of the Shadow Cabinet is unwilling to live by the convention of solidarity, they must depart to the backbench.”

Mr Hastie said out of respect for Sussan Ley’s leadership, he was resigning from the frontbench.

“Sussan deserves the opportunity to lead, unencumbered by interventions from Shadow Cabinet colleagues, especially as the Coalition builds out a policy platform for the 2028 election,” he said.

“I am grateful for the opportunity to have served as the Shadow Home Affairs Minister, and I wish Sussan and the Shadow Cabinet every success in this term.”

When asked what he would do if Ms Ley supported the net-zero-by-2050 target, Mr Hastie previously made it plain: “That leaves me without a job.”

“I’ve nailed my colours to the mast,” he said.

“If I go out with the tide in two-and-a-half years, that’s great. I’ll get a lot more time with my kids back.”

Given the policy is under review, Mr Hastie has the freedom to roam and express his opinion for now. It’s likely to prove persuasive internally.

Intriguingly, the WA MP and SAS veteran accepted his views were in the minority.

“Most of my colleagues, in fact, don’t support my position. So, I’m in the minority here.” 

Liberal leader Sussan Ley announced his decision to leave the frontbench on Friday night.

“Three days ago, I sent every member of my Shadow Ministry a ‘Charter Letter’,” she said.

“These letters provide clear direction and a tasking to shadow ministers beyond the conventional mirroring of government portfolios, putting the Coalition on a proactive policy path.

“They set out key performance indicators, general expectations and shared policy priorities that I have personally agreed with each Shadow Minister. They enable the Coalition to develop a serious and credible policy platform to take to the next election, where we will draw a clear contrast with Labor.

“These letters were developed in extensive consultation with individual members of the Shadow Ministry and were the product of more than 50 one-on-one conversations between me and my team, including with Andrew Hastie.

“In each phone conversation, and then in each letter, I made clear that every member of the team was bound by the ‘Shadow Ministerial Solidarity’ Convention, both in public commentary and on parliamentary votes.

“This expectation is not new and is a fundamental feature of our Westminster system of government. Compliance with this Convention has always been a prerequisite for serving in both Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet.

“Today, Mr Hastie informed me via telephone, that he would be unable to comply with this longstanding and well-understood requirement, and on that basis he would be resigning his position as Shadow Minister for Home Affairs. Mr Hastie did not raise any matters relating to policy on this call.

“I thanked Mr Hastie for his service, and assured him he would continue to be a very valued part of my Coalition team.

Ms Ley said that with “news breaking today that so-called ISIS brides have secretly returned to our shores — further confirmation that Labor has once again failed Australians on national security — this is a very important time for the Opposition to have a strong voice scrutinising government failures in the Home Affairs portfolio.”

“Australians expect strong borders, but under Labor we are seeing secrecy at the expense of security. It is disappointing that this crucial Opposition portfolio has been left vacant today,” she said.

“Formal changes to the Shadow Ministry will be announced shortly. In the interim, Senator James Paterson will serve as the Acting Shadow Minister for Home Affairs.”

365840292,Madras HC orders SIT probe into stampede at Vijay’s rally (Lead),"Chennai, Oct 3 (IANS) Expressing pain over the loss of lives, the Madras High Court on Friday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under IPS officer Asra Garg to probe the Karur stampede, which claimed 41 lives on September 27.

“Watching the videos is painful,” said Justice N Senthilkumar, expressing shock that only two people had been arrested so far in connection with the incident.

The High Court pulled up the Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) leaders and organisers of the rally by actor-turned-politician Vijay for their failure to rescue the public and children, and for not taking responsibility for the incident.

“Whether they are leaders or party workers, after this incident, while the President, Prime Minister, Chief Minister, and all political parties expressed grief and engaged in rescue efforts, the organisers of the event — the party members — had completely walked away,” said the court.

While constituting the SIT, Justice Senthilkumar directed the Karur Police to immediately hand over all case documents related to the stampede to the probe panel.

In a related matter, the High Court reserved its decision on the anticipatory bail plea of TVK General Secretary Bussi Anand and Deputy General Secretary Nirmal Kumar. The court did not specify a date for delivering its decision.

Earlier, the High Court took note of an accident involving Vijay’s campaign and asked, “Has a case been registered in this regard?”

In the backdrop of the surfacing of videos of the alleged accident, the court said, “What prevents registering a case? Even if no complaint is given, the police must file one.”

In a related matter, a division bench of M. Dhandapani and M. Jothiraman rejected a petition filed by BJP leader Uma Anandan seeking a CBI probe into the stampede but gave the petitioner the liberty to approach the court if the investigation is not done properly.

“Don’t treat this court as a political arena,” said the court, questioning the petitioner’s locus standi in the matter.

“If aggrieved persons come to this court, we will rescue,” said the court, asking the petitioner to first let the investigation into the September 27 incident at Karur move forward from its current initial stage.

The BJP leader had sought High Court direction for a probe by the CBI into the incident, claiming that the fatalities were linked to alleged official apathy.

The High Court passed the order while hearing a clutch of petitions. Some petitions taken had sought an enhancement in compensation announced by the authorities for the victims.

The bench took note of the Tamil Nadu government’s suggestion to frame standard operating procedures (SoPs) in respect of rallies or meetings, disallowing events near state or national highways.

The court suggested that in future, when such political rallies or meetings are held at designated places, the government and political parties must ensure that there are proper arrangements for drinking water and sanitation.

The bench also said that escape routes and parking facilities should be provided to minimise the chances of stampedes.","Chennai, Oct 3 (IANS) Expressing pain over the loss of lives, the Madras High Court on Friday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under IPS officer Asra Garg to probe&#8230; Continue reading Madras HC orders SIT probe into stampede at Vijay’s rally (Lead)

365840300,Women’s World Cup: Smith shines as England reduce South Africa to second-lowest total of 69,"Guwahati, Oct 3 (IANS) Linsey Smith’s stunning new-ball burst set the tone for England Women as they bundled out South Africa Women for just 69 in 20.4 overs – the Proteas’ second-lowest total in ODI World Cup history in the fourth match of the Women’s World Cup 2025 at Baraspara Stadium, on Friday.

Having opted to bowl first, England struck immediately through Smith, who removed both openers in her first two overs. She first dismissed South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt for 5 with a sharp caught-and-bowled chance before cleaning up Tazmin Brits, also for 5. Lauren Bell then added to the early damage by knocking over Sune Luus for 2.

Smith wasn’t done yet, and her control with the new ball earned her a third scalp as she sent back Marizanne Kapp for 4 to leave South Africa in deep trouble. From there, captain Nat Sciver-Brunt took charge, striking twice in quick succession to remove Anneke Bosch (6) and Chloe Tryon (2), reducing the innings to a desperate 38 for 6 by the 11th over.

The slide continued despite a gritty effort from wicketkeeper-batter Sinalo Jafta, who top-scored with 22 off 36 balls. But she too fell in the 18th over, bowled by Sophie Ecclestone, whose left-arm spin accounted for Nadine de Klerk (3) and Jafta to finish with 2 for 19. Charlie Dean wrapped up the tail with 2 for 14, while Bell ended with 1 for 24.

The collective effort, however, was headlined by Smith’s brilliant figures of 3 for 7 in just five overs, which dismantled South Africa’s top order and ensured the Proteas never recovered. Sciver-Brunt chipped in with a miserly 2 for 5, underlining England’s total dominance.

With South Africa folded for 69, England’s batters now have a modest target to chase, and an opportunity to finish the job quickly to give their net run rate a healthy boost in this World Cup campaign.

Brief scores:

365840286,"India will achieve global leadership by 2047, says Amit Shah in Rohtak","Rohtak, Oct 3 (IANS) Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah on Friday said under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country is progressing towards becoming a developed nation, and India will achieve global leadership by the centenary of its independence in 2047. 

“When the centenary of India’s independence is celebrated, India will achieve global leadership, and khadi will play a vital role in it. Khadi and village industries are becoming a powerful platform for millions of weavers,” he said.

HM Shah said this while interacting with artisans at the Khadi Mahotsav held at the Maharshi Dayanand University campus here in Haryana.

The Union Minister, along with Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini, distributed modern machines, toolkits, and margin money worth Rs 301 crore under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), encouraging artisans to move towards self-reliance through Swadeshi.

The Union Minister also virtually inaugurated PMEGP units, a central wool processing plant, and khadi and village industries buildings, including the newly-constructed office and warehouse of KVIC in Panchkula.

HM Shah remarked that after independence, previous governments paid no attention to khadi and completely neglected khadi and the village industries.

He said when Prime Minister Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he pledged to develop khadi and worked to revive KVIC.

HM Shah said that because of the Prime Minister’s interest in khadi and his connection with the weavers, the khadi business has grown from Rs 33,000 crore to Rs 1.70 lakh crore in just 11 years.

He emphasised that the benefits of this increased turnover have gone to the weavers, not any capitalist or private industrialist.

He added that KVIC has now developed excellent packaging and marketing systems.

Speaking at the event, he expressed happiness in distributing 12 types of modern machines, including automatic charkhas, leather machines, and also margin money to the weavers.

The Union Cooperation Minister said the vision of ‘swaraj’ at the time of Independence was incomplete without ‘swadeshi’ and ‘swabhasha’.

In this direction, Prime Minister Modi has inspired 140 crore Indians to adopt indigenous products.

He said the concept of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and the ‘swadeshi’ movement will be beneficial for every Indian.

He further informed that the Prime Minister recently reduced GST on over 395 items, giving a Diwali gift to the people.

HM Shah said khadi has an important role in strengthening the country’s economy, and that along with ‘khadi for nation’, there should also be ‘khadi for fashion’, with active participation from every Indian. He appealed to the public at the festival to adopt khadi, promote indigenous products, and make the country self-reliant.

Chief Minister Saini, while welcoming the Union Home Minister’s remarks, said, “Khadi is our heritage, and khadi products are moving rapidly from local to global”.

He said the khadi and village industries have now become a strong medium for a self-reliant India.

Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, khadi has achieved unprecedented growth and is gaining recognition at the international level. He described the Khadi Mahotsav as a celebration of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, driven by the vision of Prime Minister Modi.","Rohtak, Oct 3 (IANS) Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah on Friday said under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country is progressing towards becoming a developed&#8230; Continue reading India will achieve global leadership by 2047, says Amit Shah in Rohtak

365840288,RBI proposes easier rules for companies to raise foreign currency loans,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday released draft rules to make it easier for Indian companies to raise money in foreign currencies. 

The central bank has suggested widening the pool of both borrowers and lenders who can take part in external commercial borrowings (ECBs).

“As announced in the statement on developmental and regulatory policies dated October 01, it has been decided to rationalise regulations pertaining to external commercial borrowing (ECB) included in the Foreign Exchange Management (Borrowing and Lending) Regulations, 2018 issued under FEMA, 1999,” RBI said in its statement.

“The borrowing limits are proposed to be linked to a borrower’s financial strength and ECB are proposed to be raised at market determined interest rates,” the Central Bank added.

Under the draft, companies will be allowed to raise funds overseas based on their financial strength.

“The borrower and lender base eligible for ECB transactions is proposed to be expanded to enhance opportunities of credit flow,” RBI stated.

Firms could borrow up to $1 billion or as much as 300 per cent of their net worth, whichever is higher.

“The end-use restrictions and Minimum Average Maturity requirements are proposed to be simplified,” the Central Bank added.

The RBI has also said that these borrowings can be raised at market-determined interest rates, giving companies more flexibility in accessing global funds.

The move is aimed at making overseas fundraising more attractive and aligned with international practices, while also ensuring that companies with strong financials have better access to foreign capital.

The RBI has invited feedback on the draft rules from stakeholders and the public until October 24. The final regulations will be issued after reviewing the suggestions.

“Comments/ feedback on the draft regulations may be submitted through the respective link under the ‘Connect 2 Regulate’ Section available on the RBI’s website or may be forwarded via email by October 24, with the subject line ‘Feedback on draft ECB framework’, RBI added.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday released draft rules to make it easier for Indian companies to raise money in foreign currencies.

365840280,Everyone knows the person behind Prajwal Revanna’s case: Deve Gowda,"Bengaluru, Oct 3 (IANS) Without naming Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Friday that everyone knows the person behind the infamous sex-scandal case of Prajwal Revanna. 

“For three months, the media camped day and night outside my house from 6 am to 10 pm. Who instigated all of that? You all saw those days yourselves. You know very well the force that was behind it,” said Deve Gowda, indirectly pointing the fingers at Shivakumar.

Former JD-S MP Prajwal Revanna, grandson of Deve Gowda, was caught in the infamous sex CD and rape case that shocked Karnataka.

Speaking at a press conference at J.P. Bhavan, Deve Gowda indirectly further lashed out at Shivakumar, without naming him, over the latter’s allegation that the Deve Gowda-Kumaraswamy family is waiting to send him to jail.

He was referring to the days preceding the arrest of Prajwal Revanna. He had disappeared after the case came to light and returned to India only after a personal appeal by Deve Gowda and Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.

The court has convicted Prajwal Revanna with life imprisonment in one of the cases. Prajwal Revanna stated in court that the allegations are part of a conspiracy to hinder his political growth.

“JD-S is a small political party. We will work beyond our strength to sustain our party. I will not speak about Shivakumar. Ever since he contested elections against me 20 years ago, I have not talked about him, and I will not now either,” said Deve Gowda.

Regarding the Bidadi township project, the former Prime Minister said that he is fully aware of all details, including farmers’ opposition to land acquisition.

“The Congress is in power. People must give their verdict during elections. Until then, we must wait,” he said.","Bengaluru, Oct 3 (IANS) Without naming Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K.

365840290,Golden Hour is important for reporting cybercrimes: CM Fadnavis,"Mumbai, Oct 3 (IANS) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said that the ‘Golden Hour’ is important in cyber fraud cases and sooner a complaint is filed the easier it is to save and recover the amount stolen.

“Therefore, if you find that you have been subjected to cyber fraud, you should immediately file a complaint on the helpline numbers 1930 or 1945 without delay.

“Just like the life of an accident victim can be saved if treatment is received in the ‘Golden Hour’, in the same way, cyber crime can be detected and the amount can be saved if the complaint is filed during the Golden Hour,” CM Fadnavis said in his address after inaugurating the Cyber Awareness Month function.

The function was attended by Director General of Police Rashmi Shukla, Additional Chief Secretary of Home Department Iqbal Singh Chahal, actor Akshay Kumar, actress Rani Mukherjee, Dr Farooq Qazi and Prof Manjesh Hanwal of IIT-Mumbai.

CM Fadnavis said, “Preventing cybercrime is the biggest challenge in today’s digital age. It is necessary to prevent financial losses along with punishing the criminal after the crime is committed. Awareness is the most effective solution to prevent cyber fraud.”

“Due to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), common people are being deceived by misusing new techniques like phishing, OTP fraud, deepfakes, voice and face cloning. We provide information through social media, online transactions, payments. After accepting cookies, personal information can be misused. This leads to scams, extortion, cyber bullying,” he observed.

CM Fadnavis said that world-class cyber security labs, response centres and regulatory mechanisms have been set up in the state. This allows immediate action to be taken after fraud and minimize the damage.

“However, timely complaints are important for this. Technology is the threat and technology is the solution. Our capacity to deal with challenges like deepfake is increasing. Any digital crime leaves its digital fingerprint behind. Therefore, both capacity and public awareness are equally important. It is necessary to spread information about cyber security to the youth, and communicators play an important role in this work,” he noted.

Director General of Police Rashmi Shukla said, “The Ministry of Railways has launched a remarkable awareness campaign to keep its citizens alert and protect them immediately. Cyber security alerts are being given daily at every major railway station in the country.

“Lakhs of citizens are hearing these messages every day in their daily lives. The state police system, recognising the need for public awareness, is also conducting an intensive public awareness campaign in all cities, districts and social media platforms in Maharashtra.”

A documentary on cyber security was shown on this occasion. Also, a comic booklet for children called ‘Cyber Yoddha’ was released by CM Fadnavis. Also, cyber warriors working for cyber awareness were felicitated.","Mumbai, Oct 3 (IANS) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said that the &#8216;Golden Hour&#8217; is important in cyber fraud cases and sooner a complaint is filed the easier&#8230; Continue reading Golden Hour is important for reporting cybercrimes: CM Fadnavis

365840284,Natural consequence of Pakistan’s oppressive approach: India on PoK protests,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) India on Friday termed the massive protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), which have reportedly resulted in over a dozen deaths till now, as a “natural consequence of Pakistan’s oppressive approach and systemic plundering of resources from these territories.” 

Addressing a weekly media briefing in New Delhi, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said New Delhi is aware of the ongoing protests in several parts of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, including the brutalities being committed by Pakistani forces on locals.

“We have seen reports on protests in several areas of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, including brutalities by Pakistani forces on innocent civilians. We believe that it is a natural consequence of Pakistan’s oppressive approach and systemic plundering of resources from these territories, which remain under its forcible and illegal occupation. Pakistan must be held accountable for its horrific human rights violations,” Jaiswal told reporters.

Reaffirming India’s stance, the MEA spokesperson emphasised that Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, will always remain an integral part of India.

“Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are inalienable part of India, will remain and have always been part of India. Those territories (PoK) are our inalienable part,” he mentioned.

The statement comes after several people, including police personnel, have been killed and dozens injured during the ongoing violent clashes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir that began during the strike called by the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) for reforms and public facilities in the region.

Business and other activities have remained shut in the PoK due to the strike amid disruption in communication in the region. Incidents of violence occurred in Dhir Kot and other parts of PoK with the local authorities saying that 172 police personnel and 50 civilians have also been injured in the clashes.

The regions of Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, Poonch, Neelum, Bhimber and Palandri have been brought to a standstill after the strike call given by JAAC central leader Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Pakistani daily The Express Tribune reported on Thursday.

Markets remained shut, roads were blocked and internet services were restricted in Muzaffarabad, excluding the areas which share border with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

Three police personnel were killed and nine others were injured during an attack carried out by armed men belonging to the JAAC in Dhir Kot, the daily reported, citing reports. The JAAC had been raising several demands, including an end to the privileges enjoyed by the ruling elite, the abolition of 12 assembly seats reserved for refugees, and the removal of the quota system. Furthermore, the committee has demanded free and uniform education across the territory, free healthcare facilities, reforms in the judicial work of the region and the development of an international airport.

Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a top leader of the Awami Action Committee in PoK, has accused Pakistan’s government and army of oppressing locals, comparing them to a witch bent on killing own people.

He also alleged that the voices of ordinary people are being crushed, the media is being silenced and questioned the legitimacy of Pakistani forces that “kill those they claim to represent”.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) India on Friday termed the massive protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), which have reportedly resulted in over a dozen deaths till now, as&#8230; Continue reading Natural consequence of Pakistan&#8217;s oppressive approach: India on PoK protests

365840298,"Ebola virus strain found in semen, breast milk months after infection: Study","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) US researchers have detected the Sudan Ebola virus strain in semen and breast milk among survivors, about eight months after infection, raising concerns about the potential for sexual and mother-to-child transmission.

Nearly 60 per cent of the survivors of an outbreak in Uganda from 2022-23 reported ongoing and debilitating health issues, even two years post-infection, that interfered with their daily lives, noted researchers at Washington State University.

“This is the first time anyone has been able to closely follow Sudan Ebola survivors over the long term, and the results show the virus continues to affect people’s lives well after an outbreak ends,” said lead researcher Kariuki Njenga, Professor in the WSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

“Just as concerning is the fact we detected the virus in semen and breast milk, which shows there is a risk survivors could pass on Ebola months after recovery,” Njenga added.

Ebola is a severe, often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans caused by four known strains: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Taï Forest.

The Zaire and Sudan are the deadliest strains, with case fatality rates ranging from 75-90 per cent for Zaire and 55-65 per cent for Sudan.

The study followed 87 survivors from the outbreak in Uganda alongside a control group of 176 community members who had not been infected. Survivors reported symptoms affecting the musculoskeletal system (45 per cent), central nervous system (36 per cent), and eyes (20 per cent) at much higher rates than those in the control group.

Half of the survivors reported multiple persistent symptoms, including memory loss, joint and back pain, and depression that resulted in an inability to perform basic activities. These symptoms remained consistent across the two-year follow-up period.

“These results point to a kind of ‘long Ebola,’ very similar to what the world has seen with long Covid,” Njenga said. “Symptoms did not significantly improve across two years of follow-up, which is why long-term care and support for survivors are critical.”

Researchers stopped detecting the Sudan Ebola virus RNA in semen for up to 210 days and in breast milk for up to 199 days after infection. In two men, the virus reappeared in semen samples eight months after consecutive negative results, suggesting possible latency and reactivation.

The study comes amid the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Kasai Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). As of Wednesday, a total of 64 cases had been reported, including 42 deaths, while 12 patients have recovered and been discharged.

The Congolese government declared the outbreak on September 4, marking the country’s 16th Ebola outbreak since the virus was first identified in 1976, Xinhua news agency reported.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) US researchers have detected the Sudan Ebola virus strain in semen and breast milk among survivors, about eight months after infection, raising concerns about the&#8230; Continue reading Ebola virus strain found in semen, breast milk months after infection: Study

India will also be represented through Shashank Narde and Manav Sreekumar, who enter as the lowest-ranked pair in the field.

365809268,"Slow start for Akshay Bhatia, four-way lead at Sanderson Farms","Jackson (USA), Oct 3 (IANS) Akshay Bhatia had a disappointing start despite an even par card on the opening day of the 2025 Sanderson Farms Championship in the Fall season of the PGA Tour. Bhatia, who posted an even-par 72 in the opening round, was tied for 88th at the Country Club of Jackson.

Bhatia, entering as the betting favourite, bogeyed the seventh and the eighth and turned in 2-over. Birdies on the 10th, 12th and 13th saw him get under par, but bogeys on the 14th and 16th dashed those hopes despite a birdie in between on the 15th.

Bhatia needs a fast start on the second day tomorrow to move up the leader board and stay in the tournament.

There was a four-way tie for the lead, with Eric Cole, Sam Ryder, Danny Walker, and Garrick Higgo all sharing the first–round lead at 7-under 65.

Ryder played bogey-free and Danny Walker finished with a pair of birdies. Cole managed 10 birdies, which helped offset a double bogey late in the round, and Garrick Higgo continued to show strides after from an injury since slowed his progress after a win earlier this year.

Ryder is at No. 110 in the FedExCup, while Walker is at No. 104. The Sanderson Farms Championship is part of the FedExCup Fall where players who did not reach the PGA TOUR’s postseason have to finish in the top 100 to keep their full cards.

Walker tied for sixth in THE PLAYERS Championship, but the last five months have been miserable. He showed up at The Country Club of Jackson having missed eight straight cuts to fall out of the top 100.

Rasmus Hojgaard (69) was T-35, coming straight from New York and Ryder Cup victory in his debut for the European Team. He is at No. 87 and now turns his attention toward keeping his card.","Jackson (USA), Oct 3 (IANS) Akshay Bhatia had a disappointing start despite an even par card on the opening day of the 2025 Sanderson Farms Championship in the Fall season&#8230; Continue reading Slow start for Akshay Bhatia, four-way lead at Sanderson Farms

365809266,Will seek legal intervention to secure GST funds: CM Siddaramaiah,"Mysuru, Oct 3 (IANS) Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has stated that his government will seek legal action to secure the funds, following the recent decision by the Central government to simplify GST, which would lead to an estimated loss of Rs 15,000 crore for the state. 

“We will seek legal intervention to secure the funds,” CM Siddaramaiah said, adding that the Centre took the step in view of the upcoming elections in Bihar.

Speaking to the media at his residence in Mysuru on Friday, he said that the Central government, which had implemented GST in 2017 and set the rates, had been collecting higher rates over the past eight years. “Will the government now return the extra GST collected from the people? The Central government is now reducing the GST rates that it had increased earlier and is congratulating itself for it. They need not justify that the GST cuts were due to the Bihar elections,” he said.

Responding to the shortfall in Central grants, he said that out of an estimated Rs 17,000 crore in grants due from the Centre, only Rs 3,200 crore has been released to Karnataka. While 18 per cent of Central funds are allocated to Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka receives only 3.5 per cent.

“Karnataka contributes Rs 4.5 lakh crore in taxes to the Centre, yet we receive only 14 paise per rupee. Special grants for the 15th Finance Commission recommended by the Commission — Rs 5,490 crore, Rs 3,000 crore for lake development, Rs 3,000 crore for roads, Rs 5,000 crore for the Bhadra dam project — have not been released. A total of Rs 17,000 crore due in grants has been withheld. If necessary, like last time, we will seek legal intervention to secure the funds,” he said.

CM Siddaramaiah further added that despite the challenge of covering expenditures under the state’s five guarantees with limited Central funds, the government would meet the challenge courageously.

“GST simplification has caused states to face greater losses. Karnataka will incur an estimated annual loss of Rs 15,000 crore. The Central government provides GST compensation according to the benefit of NDA states. Karnataka’s BJP MPs only praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi; they do not think about the state’s interests,” he said.

Responding to questions about the progress of the caste survey in the state, he said that surveys covering around three crore people from 80 lakh households have already been completed. The survey of 1.8 crore households is expected to finish by October 7, and further decisions will be taken based on the progress.

Replying to Union Minister Pralhad Joshi’s statement that the survey was being conducted to prevent vote transfers and caste manipulations, Siddaramaiah said that Joshi, being a Central minister, should clarify the purpose of the caste survey to be done by the Centre.

“Is the Central government intending to divide people by caste and religion? In Karnataka, economic, social, and educational surveys are being conducted to gather information about the people’s condition. Earlier, caste information like Brahmin, Christian, and other categories was included in the Kantraraju report. If people voluntarily declare their caste, the government is not responsible. The Commission has removed these caste categories from the list. Therefore, the Commission will only receive voluntary data. There is no question of dividing people by caste. BJP is misleading the people for political purposes,” he said.

Responding to Leader of Opposition R. Ashoka’s claim that even if the government does not resolve farmers’ issues, it should be referred to as a dead government, Siddaramaiah said, “Although Ashoka is the opposition leader, he speaks under the direction of the RSS. His statement is politically motivated,” he added.","Mysuru, Oct 3 (IANS) Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has stated that his government will seek legal action to secure the funds, following the recent decision by the Central government to&#8230; Continue reading Will seek legal intervention to secure GST funds: CM Siddaramaiah

365809260,Bihar Minister rejects Prashant Kishor’s corruption claims,"Patna, Oct 3 (IANS) Bihar Rural Works Minister Ashok Choudhary on Friday dismissed corruption allegations levelled against him by Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor, saying that mere accusations do not make anyone guilty.

Speaking to reporters in Patna, he said, “If anyone can prove I own even one dhur of land, I am ready to become that person’s slave. My wealth is in the public domain, and anyone can verify it.”

He added, “If someone says I am in partnership with Trump (Donald Trump), will anyone believe it? Let anyone prove that I or my family own one dhur of land or even property worth Rs 1 crore. No political career has ever ended merely because of allegations, and mine will not either.”

The minister emphasised his long political journey, saying, “I have been in politics since my student life. I served as the Congress state president for over four years and distributed tickets. In 2020, I was the executive president of JD(U). Those who think they can finish my career by just making allegations are mistaken. I will continue to be in Bihar politics, and no one can stop me.”

On the defamation case he filed against Prashant Kishor, Minister Choudhary said that he has received Kishor’s reply and his legal team is examining it.

Earlier, on September 23, Ashok Choudhary filed a Rs 100 crore defamation notice against Kishor.

The minister had demanded an unconditional written and public apology from Kishor within seven days, failing which, he had threatened criminal proceedings and a civil suit for damages.

In response, Kishor, on September 29, criticised Ashok Chaudhary for amassing illegal assets worth Rs 200 crore and taking hefty commissions on government contracts.

365814936,First woman appointed leader of Church of England,"Britain appointed Sarah Mullally as the new Archbishop of Canterbury on Friday, the first time a woman has been named leader of the Church of England in the 1,400 year history of the role.

Ms Mullally also becomes the ceremonial head of some 85 million Anglicans worldwide, with the appointment of a woman risking deeper theological divides with some of the more conservative branches of the church in African nations.

Reforms introduced 11 years ago made it possible for a woman to hold the office, and by being named as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury, Ms Mullally becomes the female leader of one of last areas of British public life to have been led by men.

But for Anglicans globally, about two-thirds of whom live in countries like Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, the appointment of the first female Archbishop could further highlight their difference with the mother church in England.

From nurse to priest

Ms Mullally, 63, is a former nurse who worked as England's Chief Nursing Officer in the early 2000s. She has advocated for creating an open and transparent culture in churches which allows for difference and disagreement.

""There are great commonalities between nursing and being a priest. It's all about people, and sitting with people during the most difficult times in their lives,"" she once told a magazine.

Reflecting the Church of England's status as England's established church, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office announced the decision with the formal consent of King Charles.

As monarch, Charles is the supreme governor of the Church of England, a role established in the 16th century when King Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church.

365814934,One of Manchester attack victims reportedly killed by a bullet fired by police,"Authorities say one of two victims in the Manchester synagogue attack may have been killed by a bullet fired by police.

Greater Manchester Police chief Stephen Watson said a forensic examiner ""has provisionally determined, that one of the deceased victims would appear to have suffered a wound consistent with a gunshot injury"".

He said the attacker did not have a gun and the only shots fired were by police.

""It is currently believed that the suspect, Jihad Al Shamie, was not in possession of a firearm and the only shots fired were from GMP's Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police said in a statement.

""It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end.""

Police added that one of those injured and receiving treatment in hospital also suffered a gunshot wound. 

Both people believed to have been shot were behind the synagogue doors.

Three people remain in hospital

Police said local residents Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, died in the attack on Thursday on the Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in the Manchester suburb of Crumpsall. Three other people remain hospitalised in serious condition.

Police shot and killed a suspect seven minutes after he rammed a car into pedestrians outside the synagogue on Thursday morning and then attacked them with a knife. He wore what appeared to be an explosives belt, which was found to be fake.

The assault took place as people gathered at the Orthodox synagogue on Yom Kippur, the day of atonement and the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar.

Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, the head of Orthodox Judaism in Britain, said the attack was the result of ""an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred"" on the streets and online.

365803796,Maxi takes step towards return,"Maxwell broke his arm in a training accident ahead of the Twenty20 tour of New Zealand earlier this week but has taken the initial steps towards returning sooner than expected.

He underwent surgery on Thursday which was viewed as the best way to avoid any healing complications and shorten the timeline of return.

Maxwell, barring any setbacks, remains a slim chance to be back for the white-ball series against India which runs through until November 8.

The veteran all-rounder is a certainty to be fit for the upcoming Big Bash League season and Twenty20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year.

Maxwell, who turns 37 this month, was injured while bowling in the nets to teammate Mitch Owen.

He was in sublime form prior to the setback, having scored a one-day century for Victoria in preparation for New Zealand.

Wicketkeeper-bat Josh Philippe replaced Maxwell in the squad after a strong showing for Australia A in India last month.

Australia won the first cross-Tasman Twenty20 by six wickets, courtesy of a Mitch Marsh masterclass.

365803792,Drizzle fizzle: Aussies secure series through washout,"The Aussies second Twenty20 against New Zealand on Friday at Bay Oval was abandoned after tempestuous weather allowed for just 13 deliveries to be bowled.

Australia’s first match victory means it will at worst finish the three-match series in a tie and still retain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.

The rain was a threat from the outset, delaying the toss before then reducing the match to a nine-over affair.

New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell sent Mitch Marsh’s Australia into the unfamiliar predicament of batting first.

The Aussies made a dour start in the difficult conditions by losing opener Travis Head (5) and scoring just 16 runs in the 2.1 overs bowled.

Australia still has the chance to win the trophy outright when the two sides meet in the third and final match on Saturday night.

Marsh said there was “a lot to play for” in the final encounter despite it not having any impact on the trophy.

“Days like today are always difficult, for both teams, you’re waiting around all day,” the Australian captain told the broadcast post game.

“We obviously do our best to make sure we get a game for the crowd especially who hung around very patiently in the rain.

“But yeah the weather won out today … I think both crowds, you can see how keen they are to have cricket up here.

“A trophy like the Chappell-Hadlee holds a lot of history for both teams.

“Now obviously you come on an away tour and want to try and win it, for us to retain it, we certainly tried to come to win it so there’s a lot to play for (Saturday).”

Marsh was batting at the time the match was abandoned and joked it saved him the embarrassment of a mid-innings retirement.

“I was one off five in a nine over game, I’ve never felt more pressure in my whole career,” he joked.

“It was nice to walk off, actually, I was about to retire myself.”

365803794,Bergers confident of completing Cup fairytale,"The Bergers, the NPL Victoria champions, are aiming for a fourth successive win over A-League opposition in what has a been a remarkable Cup run this year.

Anastasiadis’ men’s path to the decider has included wins over Western Sydney Wanderers (3-0), Wellington Phoenix (4-0) and Auckland FC (2-0).

In all those victories, impressive winger Ngor was in Heidelberg’s starting line-up.

However, Ngor had been on loan to the club from A-League team Central Coast, and with the loan period having ended earlier this week, the player who won the 2023 Finnish Cup with Ilves has returned to the Mariners, whose new campaign starts on October 19.

“We wanted him to stay for the game, and I think he wanted to, but his obligations with Central Coast came first, so we had to abide by that,” Anastasiadis said.

“Sabit was great throughout the year but we knew it was a loan situation with him. Central Coast needed him back so we really didn’t have a say.

“We’re a (squad) that’s made up of 22 players, so we know at any one stage, if someone’s missing that someone will come in and do the job probably even better.”

Anastasiadis said it had been an eventful week, but that the time had now come to “get on the park and try to do the business”.

No non-A-League club has won the Australia Cup since the knockout competition’s inception in 2014 when it was known as the FFA Cup.

Sydney United 58 is the only other non-A-League outfit to have reached a decider, but was beaten 2-0 by Macarthur FC in 2022.

“It’ll be a great occasion for everyone at the club and the NPL in general around the country,” Anastasiadis said.

“I can imagine when Sydney United made (the final), it would have been the same sort of feeling.

“We’ve had a lot of well wishes from a lot of other NPL clubs, Victorian ones. It’s been great to have their support, and we need that.

“We’re all in the same boat. The perception of the NPL hopefully will take a different direction. The A-League is a league where they can dip into the NPL and get players from there.” 

Standing in the way of a Heidelberg fairytale is a Mark Milligan-coached Jets outfit seeking to lift the club’s first piece of silverware since winning the A-League title in 2008.

“Regardless of whether we’re favourites or not favourites, we have to capitalise on the moments more, on the occasion, on us becoming a better team and on the opportunity to win silverware,” Milligan said.

“We want that expectation in terms of making finals, in terms of playing in big games.”",NPL Victoria champions Heidelberg United are chasing history against Newcastle Jets in the Australia Cup final after three stunning wins over A-League opposition.,https://www.news.com.au/sport/football/heidelberg-united-seeking-fourth-victory-over-an-aleague-club-to-be-crowned-australia-cup-winners/news-story/f094a30258cecbc3bae6944f054169ac?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/acd5dcee7b740fa1a79f1c3872b42f20,,2025-10-03 10:18:07,Marco Monteverde,['Marco Monteverde'],en,au,0.126,

“As a young father, this decision is also about building the next stage of my life with my wife Grace and our son Charlie. The opportunity to grow both on and off the field in a stable and supportive environment was really important in making this choice 

“Carlton will always be part of me. It’s where I grew up, where my AFL career began, and it’s deeply connected to my family and our history in the game. 

“I’ll always be grateful for the experiences I had there and the people who supported me, but now I’m looking forward with full focus on the Saints and doing everything I can to help us push forward.”

Silvagni played 128 games in 10 years at Carlton and now joins the Saints on a four-year-deal where he’ll be joined by former Blues teammate Tom De Koning, with paperwork lodged for his shift as well on Friday morning. 

HAWK BECOMES A CAT 

Hawthorn best and fairest winner James Worpel looks headed to Geelong after a fast-flowing opening to the AFL’s free agency period. 

In the opening hour on Friday morning, paperwork was lodged for De Koning and Silvagni to confirm their moves to St Kilda, followed by Worpel’s request to get to the Cats. 

It opens the door for negotiation now, giving the Hawks three days to decide whether they match the bid and force a trade or allow the move to go through and receive a compensation pick from the AFL.

Worpel, 26, has played 148 games for the Hawks and won the club best and fairest in 2019.

365809270,Jinkushal Industries’ makes muted debut; shares slip to lower circuit after listing,"Mumbai, Oct 3 (IANS) Jinkushal Industries Limited had a lacklustre debut on the Indian stock market on Friday, as its shares slipped into the 5 per cent lower circuit despite opening with a small premium. 

The stock got listed at Rs 125 per share on both the BSE and NSE, about 3.3 per cent higher than its issue price of Rs 121.

After listing, the stock briefly gained 2.5 per cent and touched an intra-day high of Rs 128 on the BSE.

However, the gains did not last long. Selling pressure at higher levels dragged the stock down more than 7 per cent from the day’s peak, and by the afternoon, it was locked at the 5 per cent lower circuit of Rs 118.75.

At this level, the shares were down nearly 5 per cent from their listing price and about 1.85 per cent below the issue price.

The muted debut came as a disappointment for investors who had expected stronger gains.

The grey market premium (GMP) had earlier indicated a possible listing pop of Rs 17–21 per share, which pointed towards double-digit gains.

Jinkushal Industries had seen strong investor interest during its IPO, which was open from September 25 to 29.

The issue was subscribed 65.10 times, led by robust demand from non-institutional investors.

The Qualified Institutional Buyers’ (QIBs) portion was subscribed 35.66 times, while the non-institutional investors’ segment attracted a massive 146.39 times subscription. Retail investors subscribed 47.10 times.

The IPO was a book-built issue worth Rs 116.15 crore, comprising a fresh issue of 86 lakh shares that raised Rs 104.54 crore, along with an offer-for-sale (OFS) of 10 lakh shares worth Rs 11.61 crore.

From the proceeds, the company plans to use Rs 72.68 crore to meet its working capital needs, with Rs 47.68 crore to be deployed within this financial year and the remaining by FY27.

Jinkushal Industries operates across three business verticals — export trading of customised and accessorised new construction machines, export trading of used and refurbished construction machines, and trading of its own brand of construction machines under the name ‘HexL’.","Mumbai, Oct 3 (IANS) Jinkushal Industries Limited had a lacklustre debut on the Indian stock market on Friday, as its shares slipped into the 5 per cent lower circuit despite&#8230; Continue reading Jinkushal Industries&#8217; makes muted debut; shares slip to lower circuit after listing

365809274,"PM Modi to unveil youth-focused schemes worth Rs 62,000 crore tomorrow","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil various youth-focused schemes with an outlay of more than Rs 62,000 crore on Saturday, giving a decisive push to education, skilling, and entrepreneurship for youngsters across the country.

The programme for the launch of the youth initiative at Vigyan Bhawan here, will also feature the Kaushal Deekshant Samaroh, the fourth edition of the National Skill Convocation, organized in accordance with the Prime Minister’s vision, where 46 all-India toppers from Industrial Training Institutes under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will be felicitated, according to a PMO statement issued on Friday.

The Prime Minister will launch PM-SETU (Pradhan Mantri Skilling and Employability Transformation through Upgraded ITIs), a Centrally sponsored scheme with an investment of Rs 60,000 crore. The scheme envisages the upgradation of 1,000 Government ITIs across the country in a hub-and-spoke model comprising 200 hub ITIs and 800 spoke ITIs. Each hub will be connected to four spokes on average, creating clusters equipped with advanced infrastructure, modern trades, digital learning systems and incubation facilities, the statement said.

Anchor industry partners will manage these clusters, ensuring outcome-based skilling aligned with market demand. Hubs will also house innovation centres, training-of-trainers facilities, production units and placement services, while spokes will focus on expanding access. Collectively, PM-SETU will redefine India’s ITI ecosystem, making it government-owned but industry-managed, with global co-financing support from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. In the first phase of the scheme implementation, there will be special focus on ITIs in Patna and Darbhanga.

PM Modi will inaugurate 1,200 Vocational Skill Labs established in 400 Navodaya Vidyalayas and 200 Eklavya Model Residential Schools across 34 states and Union Territories. These labs will equip students, including those in remote and tribal areas, with hands-on training in 12 high-demand sectors such as IT, automotive, agriculture, electronics, logistics and tourism. Aligned with the National Education Policy 2020 and CBSE curriculum, the project also involves the training of 1,200 vocational teachers to deliver industry-relevant learning and create an early foundation for employability, the statement said.

A special emphasis of the programme will be on transformative projects in Bihar, reflecting the state’s rich legacy and youthful demographic. The Prime Minister will launch Bihar’s revamped Mukhyamantri Nishchay Svyam Sahayata Bhatta Yojana, under which nearly five lakh young graduates every year will receive a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 for two years, along with free skill training.

He will also launch the redesigned Bihar Student Credit Card Scheme, which will provide completely interest-free education loans of up to Rs 4 lakh, significantly easing the financial burden of higher education. More than 3.92 lakh students have already availed loans worth more than Rs 7,880 crore under the scheme.

Further strengthening youth empowerment in the state, Bihar Yuva Ayog, a statutory commission for people between the ages of 18 and 45, will be formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister to channelise and harness the energies of the state’s young population.

Besides, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Skill University in Bihar, envisioned to impart industry-oriented courses and vocational education to create a globally competitive workforce.

He will also lay the foundation stone for new academic and research facilities in four universities of Bihar, namely Patna University, Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University in Madhepura, Jai Prakash Vishwavidyalaya in Chapra and Nalanda Open University in Patna, under the PM-USHA (Pradhan Mantri Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan). Together, these projects, with a total allocation of Rs 160 crore, will benefit more than 27,000 students by enabling modern academic infrastructure, advanced laboratories, hostels, and multidisciplinary learning.

The Prime Minister will also dedicate the Bihta campus of NIT Patna to the nation. With the capacity to host 6,500 students, the campus houses advanced facilities, including a 5G use case lab, a Regional Academic Centre for Space established in collaboration with ISRO, and an Innovation and Incubation Centre that has already supported nine start-ups.

PM Modi will also distribute appointment letters to more than 4,000 newly recruited candidates of the Bihar government and release Rs 450 crore in scholarships through Direct Benefit Transfer to 25 lakh students of Class 9 and 10 under the Mukhyamantri Balak/Balika Scholarship Scheme.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil various youth-focused schemes with an outlay of more than Rs 62,000 crore on Saturday, giving a decisive push to&#8230; Continue reading PM Modi to unveil youth-focused schemes worth Rs 62,000 crore tomorrow

365809256,Ashok Gehlot seeks immediate release of Sonam Wangchuk,"Jaipur, Oct 3 (IANS) Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday demanded the immediate release of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, who has been under detention in Jodhpur jail.

Wangchuk, a prominent activist from Ladakh, has been widely respected for his work in education, environmental conservation, and other social causes. Addressing the media, Gehlot expressed surprise at the rapid developments that led to Wangchuk’s arrest.

He said, “Sonam Wangchuk is such a prominent activist, working on education, the environment, and numerous other subjects, and he is held in the highest regard throughout Leh and Ladakh.”

Gehlot also highlighted Wangchuk’s previous support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting that he had consistently spoken highly of the PM.

“He was a supporter of Modi. Whenever he went anywhere, he would praise him and speak highly of him. What suddenly happened that he was charged in a way that required him to be sent to Jodhpur jail? It’s beyond comprehension,” Gehlot said.

Commenting on Wangchuk’s wife, Gehlot said, “She is very intelligent. She has been writing letters and engaging in media conversations thoughtfully. The government should take her concerns seriously.”

He emphasised that Wangchuk’s contributions to society and his clean public record made his continued detention difficult to understand. “I believe he should be released immediately,” Gehlot added, urging authorities to consider Wangchuk’s decades of social service and his reputation as a respected activist in Ladakh.

It needs to be mentioned here that Gitanjali J. Angmo, wife of Sonam Wangchuk, has approached the Supreme Court seeking the release of the climate activist, who was detained last week under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur.

Gitanjali Angmo has challenged Wangchuk’s detention and has questioned the decision to slap the anti-terror law NSA against Wangchuk.

Sharing a screenshot of her plea on X, Angmo said she had no information about Wangchuk’s health.

Wangchuk has been a vocal advocate for education reforms and sustainable development in Ladakh. Over the years, he has received national and international recognition for his efforts in creating low-cost schooling models, promoting environmental conservation, and encouraging scientific innovation among students.","Jaipur, Oct 3 (IANS) Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday demanded the immediate release of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, who has been under detention in Jodhpur jail.

The BWF World Junior Championships 2025 will be played in Guwahati, Assam from October 6 to 19. India is hosting this event 17 years after it first hosted in Pune in 2008.

“It’s probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to represent India at the World Juniors. It’s an opportunity for the juniors to play against the best in the world; this is the first stepping stone. From here you know what to expect in the next couple of years, because next you’re getting into the senior level,” said Prannoy, who won a BWF world junior bronze medal in 2010.

Pointing out that most of the Indian squad members were training at the state-of-art NCE, Prannoy said the Indian players will have the advantage of knowing the conditions well and need to make the most of it.

Sen, who like Prannoy, has bagged a bronze medal at the world junior and senior world championships, said it was important for the players to stay focused and not get distracted at this juncture. “It’s your home turf. It’s a great event to take advantage of the home support and conditions,” he said, adding there would be a lot of eyes on the players and they would have to focus on what is important.

365809276,We don’t have to depend on anyone: Women of Bihar celebrate Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana,"Patna, Oct 3 (IANS) Women across Bihar on Friday expressed joy and optimism following the launch of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, a state-funded employment scheme aimed at promoting financial independence and empowerment of women.

Launched recently by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the initiative offers direct financial support to women to help them start their own businesses or income-generating activities. Beneficiaries across the state have started receiving an initial assistance of Rs 10,000 through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).

Speaking to IANS, women in Patna shared their happiness and emphasised how the scheme is helping them become self-reliant.

“We are happy after getting Rs 10,000. I will use this money to start a photocopying business. PM Modi is doing a really good job for women. He is encouraging us to move ahead in life,” said Pinki Kumari, a beneficiary.

Sushma, another recipient, highlighted the challenges she previously faced.

“I used to do stitching work but often struggled due to a lack of funds. With this money, I’ve started selling lace and saree falls. There was a time I couldn’t support my family financially, but now, I am able to contribute.”

Tara Devi also expressed similar sentiments.

“We are grateful for the Rs 10,000 support. It has given us the chance to start our own businesses. Earlier, many women were dependent on their husbands. Now, we are becoming independent. This will not only change our lives but also help shape a better future for our children.”

Anju Kumari shared, “We received the money just before Diwali, and now I won’t have to rely on my husband for festival expenses. I feel more empowered.”

The Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana is a flagship initiative of the Government of Bihar aimed at fostering self-employment and sustainable livelihoods for women. The scheme provides financial assistance to one woman from each eligible family to help them start small-scale enterprises of their choice. Sectors covered under the scheme include agriculture, animal husbandry, tailoring, handicrafts, weaving, and other cottage industries.

Under the scheme, beneficiaries will initially receive Rs 10,000, with the potential for additional support of up to Rs 2 lakh in future phases. The initiative is community-driven, with resource persons from Self Help Groups (SHGs) offering training and guidance. To enhance market access, the state government also plans to develop Gramin Haat-Bazaars to facilitate the sale of goods produced by these women entrepreneurs.

The statewide launch of the scheme is being celebrated across districts, blocks, clusters, and villages, with more than 1 crore women participating in the programme.","Patna, Oct 3 (IANS) Women across Bihar on Friday expressed joy and optimism following the launch of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, a state-funded employment scheme aimed at promoting financial&#8230; Continue reading We don’t have to depend on anyone: Women of Bihar celebrate Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana

At a meeting with all the administrative secretaries here, he said that just like 2023, this year’s monsoon has also caused heavy loss of life and property in the state.

However, the government is doing its best with whatever limited resources it has to support and provide relief to every affected family.

He directed the secretaries to set clear targets and complete the pending tasks to extend the benefits of development projects to the people.

Taking to his X account, CM Majhi on Friday wrote, “On behalf of the people of Odisha, I extend my heartfelt thanks to Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi and Hon’ble Union Minister Shri @AshwiniVaishnawJi for their support in strengthening digital skilling in the state. The establishment of the NIELIT Centre at Balasore is a matter of great pride for Odisha and will open new avenues of learning and employment for our youth.”

“This Centre will benefit students from all over Odisha, enabling them to gain expertise in emerging technologies and contribute to the state’s growing IT ecosystem. Odisha is committed to partnering in this transformative journey and building a digitally empowered future for our youth,” added Majhi.

365809264,Congress up in arms over Sabarimala’s ‘missing gold’,"Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 3 (IANS) The serenity of Sabarimala, one of India’s most revered pilgrimage sites, has been shaken by allegations surrounding the temple’s gold-plating works, top Congress leaders said on Friday.

Leader of Opposition V.D. Satheesan and his predecessor Ramesh Chennithala on Friday have expressed dismay over the row and the latter demanded a full, High Court-supervised investigation, calling the events a blatant violation of temple rules and devotees’ trust.

Satheesan raised several questions about the missing gold.

“The company responsible claimed only copper sheets were transported to Chennai, suggesting the gold was removed locally. The High Court observed a 40-day delay before the sheets reached Chennai – where was the gold all this while?” he asked.

He also questioned the role of sponsor Unnikrishnan Potti and those who authorised the move, stressing that valuables should never leave Sabarimala without official sanction.

Chennithala described the incident as a naked breach of the Devaswom manual, which strictly forbids removing gold or other valuable items from the temple.

“All repairs should happen inside the temple, with approval from the Tantri and the Devaswom Commissioner. None of these steps was followed. 42 kg of gold sheets were sent to Chennai, but only 38 kg returned,” he claimed, highlighting the gravity of the oversight.

Both leaders voiced concern over the impact on devotees. Chennithala alleged that a secretive group may have manipulated even prominent personalities, including actor Jayaram, whose attendance at a ritual was reportedly used to conceal financial misdeeds.

Satheesan stressed that the Ayyappa idol and all temple valuables must receive special protection while the investigation unfolds.

They demanded accountability from ministers, board presidents, and officials involved since 2019, calling for transparent, swift action to restore public confidence.

Millions of devotees visit Sabarimala annually, and any mismanagement of offerings, gold, or temple assets risks shaking faith in one of the country’s most sacred shrines.

As the Kerala High Court prepares to oversee the inquiry, the unfolding drama around missing gold, secretive intermediaries, and alleged cover-ups continues to capture public attention, raising pressing questions about governance, devotion, and accountability at Sabarimala.","Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 3 (IANS) The serenity of Sabarimala, one of India’s most revered pilgrimage sites, has been shaken by allegations surrounding the temple’s gold-plating works, top Congress leaders said on&#8230; Continue reading Congress up in arms over Sabarimala&#8217;s &#8216;missing gold&#8217;

365795926,Trump’s wild transformation in less than year,"Between tariffs, continued efforts to quell wars in Ukraine and Gaza, a famous fallout with Elon Musk, an evolving Epstein saga, and now a US government shutdown (the second since 2018 during Mr Trump’s first term), the last eight months since Mr Trump’s January 20 inauguration appear to have taken a toll. 

In recent months, the 79-year-old – the oldest US President to be inaugurated – has raised concerns over his health and his arguably ageing appearance. 

“Is it just me or Trump looks 10 years older than a month ago?” one person wrote on X last month.

“Trump has dramatically aged,” another recently speculated. “Trump looks much older than 79,” said another.

“Trump looks stressed and even a bit sick,” another claimed.

Photos taken at the time of his inauguration do point to a notable difference. 

When compared to photos taken in the Oval Office earlier this week, Mr Trump appears more tired with seemingly thinner hair.

Mr Trump is not the first US President to experience a notable change in appearance during his time in office. Former President Barack Obama turned grey during his eight years in the White House.“When I came into office, I had no Gray hair, and now I have a lot,” he told an audience of students in Kuala Lumpur in 2015, two years before leaving office. 

“I don’t dye my hair, and a lot of my fellow leaders do. I won’t say who, but their barbers know, their hairdressers.”

Studies have also suggested a leader’s time in office can impact their health. 

One study, from Harvard Medical School, found after examining elections held in 17 countries from 1722 to 2015, that elected heads of government lived nearly three years fewer and had a 23 per cent greater risk of premature death than their defeated candidates.

Mystery bruising on Trump’s hands

Mr Trump’s health was called into question in August when he was pictured with dark bruising on his right hand in now viral photos.

At the time, the President was seen with clear dark blue and purple marking on the back of his right hand when meeting South Korean President Lee Jae Myung as he arrived at the White House.Days earlier, the 79-year-old was spotted with a large patch of makeup, notably a shade lighter than his skin tone, on the same hand when meeting FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the Oval Office.

The President was also spotted with a smaller bruise on his left hand while playing golf with former Major League Baseball player Roger Clemens and his son Kacy at Trump National Golf Club the day earlier.

The sightings weren’t the first time Mr Trump, was seen with bruising or redness on his hands.

A large discoloured mark could be seen on his right hand while he was hosting French President Emmanuel Macron at the Oval Office in February.

NBC News reported it had also witnessed similar bruising or redness on his right hand in August and November of last year.

White House weighs in

When asked about the bruising in February, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the mark was simply the result of the President shaking hands.

“President Trump is a man of the people,” she said at the time.

“His commitment is unwavering, and he proves that every single day.”

“President Trump has bruises on his hand because he’s constantly working and shaking hands all day, every day”.

The White House again addressed the marks in July, releasing a letter written by Mr Trump’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, who stated the bruising was “consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regime”.

In the letter, Dr Barbabella announced the President was separately diagnosed with a common vein condition, chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), after he noticed swelling in his legs.

CVI occurs where a person’s veins, most commonly in the legs, fail to efficiently return blood to the heart, leading to blood pooling.

This can cause swelling, aching and ﻿varicose veins.

Dr Barbabella said the condition was “benign and common”, particularly in those over the age of 70.

He added there was “no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial disease”, stating Mr Trump “remains in excellent health”.

‘Never felt better’: Trump hits back at rumours

Speculation of Mr Trump’s ill health culminated toward the end of August, when social media users convinced themselves the President had died. The bizarre rumour emerged after the President was absent from public view for several days, with his official schedule unusually quiet over the Labour Day weekend.

Then came a comment from Vice President JD Vance, who told an interviewer he was ready to lead if “tragedy struck”.

Hashtags such as #TrumpDead and #WhereIsTrump quickly began trending worldwide. Old conspiracy theories also resurfaced, including the viral “Trump is dead” hoax from 2022 and even memes claiming The Simpsons had predicted his demise. Mr Trump later brushed off the bizarre claims of “fake news”, telling reporters in the Oval Office he was “very active” over the Labor Day weekend. “I didn’t do anything for two days, and they said ‘there must be something wrong with him’,” he said. 

“I was very active over the weekend. I went out to visit some people at the club that I own pretty nearby on the Potomac River. No – I’ve been very active, actually.”

The President also took the opportunity to take a swipe at his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.

“You wouldn’t see (Biden) and nobody ever said there was ever anything wrong with him,” he said.

“And we know he wasn’t in the greatest of shape.”

He also addressed the speculation in a post on Truth Social, writing “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE”.",It’s been over 250 days since Donald Trump returned to the White House and his second time in office appears to be taking a toll.,https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/trumps-wild-transformation-in-less-than-one-year/news-story/3f466d4dc14a9b3ef263627eeda75842?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ecec3ac4f6604ff19d154ac154d83b91,,2025-10-03 09:47:13,Brielle Burns,['Brielle Burns'],en,au,0.094,
365795374,Andrew Hastie quits Sussan Ley’s frontbench,"Andrew Hastie has stunned colleagues and quit the Liberal frontbench Friday after staking out his own nationalist agenda on migration, manufacturing and net zero.

Hastie, who had been the opposition’s Home Affairs spokesman, phoned Opposition Leader Sussan Ley to inform her on Friday. Sources said the West Australian informed her he could no longer maintain shadow cabinet solidarity.

On Instagram Hastie claimed he had been sidelined from developing the Coalition’s policy on immigration, which this masthead’s Resolve Political Monitor has found half of voters say is too high, far more than those who believe it is at the correct level.

365793518,Surf Life Saving WA warns swimmers to stay vigilant after spate of close-calls and drowning tragedy,"The State’s peak coastal rescue organisation is pleading with swimmers to stay vigilant, after multiple close calls and a horror drowning at a tourist hot-spot north of Perth.

Surf Life Saving WA have already responded to multiple reports of swimmers caught in rips this spring, including a terrifying incident off the coast of Yanchep on Thursday.

“With the arrival of warmer weather and the school holidays, we’re seeing people heading back to the water in large numbers,” SLSWA general manager Chris Peck said on Friday.

“At this time of year on the coast, the conditions are optimal for creating high-risk situations for inexperienced beachgoers.

“Just yesterday, we were called to two incidents at Yanchep Lagoon where swimmers needed to be rescued.”

It comes just days after Tshering Penjor tragically drowned while on a family outing at Moore River, in Guilderton.

The 38-year-old father — a beloved member of WA’s Bhutanese community — fell into deep water after slipping off a sandbank along with six other family members about on Tuesday morning.

All seven were pulled from the water by bystanders, but sadly Mr Penjor could not be saved.

And on Friday, emergency services rushed to the Bunbury coast after reports a boat carrying four people had capsized near The Cut.

One person — believed to be a teenager — is fighting for life at Bunbury Regional Hospital.

The three other passengers were found safe and uninjured.

Mr Peck said SLSWA performed nearly 900 rescues last season, adding that every rescue was a “potential life saved”.

He said life savers “can’t be everywhere”, and urged people to have “appropriate swimming and water survival skills” when visiting WA waterways.

“Every one of these incidents could have ended in tragedy were it not for the actions of our life savers,” he said.

“You need to ensure that both you and your children, or friends and family members are adequately equipped to handle the conditions and to get yourselves out of trouble.

“Enrol in swimming lessons, or join our Woodside Nippers Program.”

Mr Peck said bystander rescue tragedies were also on the rise.

“While these people are making the brave decision to go to the aid of others in need, they need to assess their own abilities and the prevailing conditions before they go into the water, to ensure they are not also putting their own lives at risk,” he said.

Husband and wife Mohammad Shahidul Husan Swapan and Sabrina Ahmed died while “selflessly” trying to save their daughter at Conspicuous Beach, in Nornalup, last December.

And in January, Ricky Harris drowned at Bremer Bay while saving two children, including his own son.

The 43-year-old was holidaying when he was pulled from the water at Native Dog Beach after bravely running into the water to save two children caught in a rip.

Swimmers are urged to choose a location with active patrols and swim between the red and yellow flags.

Beachgoers are also encouraged to follow the “Stop, Look, Stay Alive” message — stop before you enter the water, look for the flags and stay alive by assessing the conditions.","The State’s peak coastal rescue organisation is pleading with swimmers to stay vigilant, after multiple close calls and a horror drowning at a tourist hot-spot north of Perth.",https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/surf-life-saving-wa-warns-swimmers-to-stay-vigilant-after-spate-of-close-calls-and-drowning-tragedy-c-20227399,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20227399/2b48c1c45e29e13c96ed237d2a57c2b900f7d62b-16x9-x0y150w800h450.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-10-03 09:33:30,Jessica Evensen,['Jessica Evensen'],en,au,0.014,
365826842,Andrew Hastie quits shadow cabinet after refusing to be ‘silent’ on immigration,"Andrew Hastie has sensationally quit the shadow cabinet, effective immediately, following months of tension between the right wing former senior soldier and the Liberal Party’s first female leader.

The Shadow Home Affairs Minister and Liberal leadership aspirant released a statement﻿ on Friday evening announcing his resignation.

“The leader has made it clear that the Shadow Home Affairs Minister won’t lead the Coalition’s response to immigration matters or develop the Coalition’s immigration strategy,” he said.

“On this basis, I made the decision that I was not able to continue in this role and remain silent on immigration.

“It is a well-established standard in the Westminster system that, if a member of the shadow cabinet is unwilling to live by the convention of solidarity, they must depart to the backbench.”

Mr Hastie said out of respect for Sussan Ley’s leadership, he was resigning from the frontbench.

“Sussan deserves the opportunity to lead, unencumbered by interventions from shadow cabinet colleagues, especially as the Coalition builds out a policy platform for the 2028 election,” he said.

“I am grateful for the opportunity to have served as the Shadow Home Affairs Minister, and I wish Sussan and the shadow cabinet every success in this term.”

In a statement, Ms Ley said she recently sent out “charter letters” to shadow ministers outlining her expectations for the Coalition.

“They enable the Coalition to develop a serious and credible policy platform to take to the next election, where we will draw a clear contrast with Labor,” Ms Ley said.

“These letters were developed in extensive consultation with individual members of the shadow ministry and were the product of more than 50 one-on-one conversations between me and my team, including with Andrew Hastie.

“Today, Mr Hastie informed me via telephone, that he would be unable to comply with this longstanding and well-understood requirement, and on that basis he would be resigning his position as Shadow Minister for Home Affairs.

“Mr Hastie did not raise any matters relating to policy on this call.“

Ms Ley said changes to the shadow ministry would be announced soon.

The Liberal Party has not committed to an immigration policy except to say that permanent and net migration figures must fall.

Some conservatives in the Liberal Party see Mr Hastie’s resignation as a first step to take the leadership away from Ms Ley.

It comes days after Mr Hastie posted on social media about wanting to make major cuts to migration.

In a video, Mr Hastie said Autralia needed to “make things here again” and pursue an “Australia first” mentality.

His recent vow to quit the frontbench should the Coalition adopt a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 also caused division in his party.

Mr Hastie was elected in 2015 at a by-election following the death of Canning MP Don Randall.

Since then, he has been a prominent member of the Liberals’ conservative side.

365814940,Aussies retain Chappell-Hadlee Trophy after rain washes out second T20I,"The second men's Twenty20I between New Zealand and Australia has been abandoned because of rain, leaving the visitors with a 1-0 lead in the three-match Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series.

Australia won the first match by six wickets on Wednesday and will retain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy whatever the outcome of the third match, which will be played Saturday, also at Bay Oval.

On Friday, rain delayed the toss by 30 minutes at Tauranga's Bay Oval, then returned before the players could take the field.

The match finally started at 6:30pm AEST with nine overs per side, but only 13 balls were bowled when the inclement weather returned.

New Zealand had won the toss and Australia was 1-16 when play ended.

Further rain is forecast on Saturday.

Bowling all-rounder Sean Abbott was brought into Australia's XI in place of Ben Dwarshuis as the only change to the squad that won the series opener.

Abbott's inclusion comes as Australia deliberated which bowler would join the first-choice attack for next year's men's T20 World Cup following Mitch Starc's retirement from the format earlier this year.

New Zealand had reshuffled its bowling attack with three changes, bringing in all-rounder Jimmy Neesham, spinner Ish Sodhi and quick Ben Sears.","The second men's Twenty20I between New Zealand and Australia is abandoned because of rain, with only 13 deliveries bowled at Tauranga's Bay Oval.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-03/cricket-t20i-nrew-zealand-vs-australia-chappell-hadlee-trophy/105850946,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2ef80a8a5d024f617698a7d2077baeab?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2240&cropW=3982&xPos=0&yPos=84&width=862&height=485,,2025-10-03 09:30:55,ABC News,['ABC News'],en,AU,0.053,

365790956,ISIS brides return to Australia from Syria,"The six women recently arrived in Beirut, where Lebanese authorities detained them for lacking visas. After passing DNA and security checks, they were issued Australian passports and flown back.

The women and children had long been monitored by Australian agencies, which anticipated some might try to return independently. Many in the wider cohort had lived under Islamic State rule and were held in Syrian camps since 2019. 

Their circumstances vary; some travelled knowingly, while others say they were coerced or were children at the time.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last month denied reports the government was organising rescues for the roughly 40 Australians still stranded. Home Affairs maintains it is not assisting repatriations.

The situation in Syria is becoming increasingly unstable,” a spokesperson for Minister Tony Burke said. 

“If any of those people find their own way to return, our security agencies are satisfied they are prepared to act in the interests of community safety.”

Opposition Leader Sussan Ley condemned the return, calling the group “a highly dangerous cohort of individuals who associated themselves with the barbaric Islamic State regime”.

“Either they knew about this cohort returning and hid it from the Australian public, or worse, family members of Islamic State terrorists returned to Australia without the government’s knowledge. Australians deserve answers,” Ley said.

Who are they?

Sydney woman Nesrine Zahab was identified as one of the ISIS brides who fought to be repatriated to Australia. The mission was so secret that even the women’s families and supporters claimed they were left in the dark.

She remained in a refugee camp with other Australians and their children, more than a decade after she claims to have been tricked into visiting the war zone, 

Nesrine was a 21-year-old university student when she left Sydney in 2014 and claims she broke away from a family holiday in Lebanon to help refugees on the Turkish side of the Syrian border.

She ended up marrying Islamic State fighter Ahmed Merhi, but insists that by the time she was pregnant with her son in 2017, she was desperate to escape.

Merhi, 27, who lost his leg in an air strike, was convicted to death by hanging a year later for being a member of Islamic State in the Central Criminal Court in Baghdad in 2018.

The former Granville Boys High School student insisted that he travelled to Syria for volunteer work and was not an Islamic fighter.

Former ASIO chief backed repatriation 

Calls for Australia to repatriate the remaining ISIS brides and their families have grown in recent months, against the backdrop of the United States, Italy, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada allowing their own citizens to return in recent years.

Former ASIO chief Dennis Richardson has backed the decision to repatriate more than a dozen ISIS brides and their children to Australia on the grounds of national security, arguing they can be monitored more safely at home.

“It is, it is very, very easy to, to present a picture of someone who walked out of their country, who has crossed the boundaries of acceptability,” he told news.com.au in September.

“They’ve made their own bed, and therefore they should lie in it. And I understand that. I think that is a perfectly reasonable perspective.

“Equally, when you’ve got young kids and when they are your own citizens, you do have some responsibility in the wider sense of the word world.

“The Americans and others, Europeans and others, many of them, many countries, have taken their own citizens back.”

Mr Richardson said it was safer to bring them home.

“If you become radicalised in that environment, you’re as capable of doing harm to Australians and others overseas as what they are here in Australia, right?

On average, 11 tropical cyclones form around Australia every year, although some meteorologists predict a dangerously active season going into next year due to an unusual mix of weather phenomena.

 Tropical cyclones that are particularly bad or damaging will have their names retired.

About 136 tropical cyclone names have been retired within the Australian region, including tropical cyclone Tracy, which struck Darwin on Christmas Day in 1974 and left 66 people dead.

Names can also be changed for political reasons.

The woman was taken to hospital, where she received medical treatment and professional support.

The victim was alone in the store, and she and the alleged offender were not known to each other, Inspector Toohey said. 

“This was a particularly heinous crime that really did shock the investigative officers when they watched the video,” he said.

Police have charged the man with three counts of rape, two counts each of sexual assault while armed and armed robbery, and one count each of kidnapping, deprivation of liberty, enter premises with intent, unlawful possession of weapon (Category H), unlawful use of a motor vehicle and unlicensed driving.

365790948,Inmate’s ear bitten off during volleyball game,"Benjamin John Wickes, 33, pleaded guilty in the ACT Supreme Court to causing grievous bodily harm and choking his fellow inmate after the volleyball game ended.

The incident took place at Canberra’s only correctional centre, the Alexander Maconochie Centre on June 25.

The two prisoners were playing volleyball on opposing sides with several other detainees when they exchanged words at the end of the game.

Wickes went under the net and approached the other prisoner before they exchanged punches and fell to the ground.

“(Wickes) bit down on the victim’s ear with sufficient force to bite off a chunk of it … then spat out the part of victim’s ear that he had bitten off,” Justice Verity McWilliam said.

The court was told Wickes continued to hit the victim, gouged his eyes with his fingers then put him in a chokehold so he could breathe when he tried to get up.

Justice McWilliam said given the incident occurred during a team sporting game it was an opportunistic attack rather than premeditated, but there was high degree of violence.

“The consequence was severe in terms of a loss of a body part,” she said.

The court was told Wickes had a disadvantaged upbringing and deserved support to overcome his challenges, but had showed no remorse towards his victim after the attack.

He was sentenced to one year, five months and five days, with a non-parole period of six months and 19 days.

The sentence will be served partially concurrent with his existing sentence, meaning he will be eligible for parole on November 19.",A prisoner will spend more time behind bars after he bit off another inmate’s ear during a volleyball game.,https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/courts-law/canberra-prison-volleyball-game-ends-in-inmates-ear-being-bitten-off/news-story/c426bed7030b20b953e50827562a8c74?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/24770b7a7c2d7bef01ba9188f08d5bcb,,2025-10-03 09:28:03,Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp,['Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp'],en,au,-0.47,
365790944,"Hastie quits, refuses to be ‘silent’ on immigration","“The leader has made it clear that the Shadow Home Affairs Minister won’t lead the Coalition’s response to immigration matters or develop the Coalition’s immigration strategy,” he said in a statement on Friday evening.

“On this basis, I made the decision that I was not able to continue in this role and remain silent on immigration.

“It is a well-established standard in the Westminster system that, if a member of the Shadow Cabinet is unwilling to live by the convention of solidarity, they must depart to the backbench.”

Mr Hastie said out of respect for Sussan Ley’s leadership, he was resigning from the frontbench.

“Sussan deserves the opportunity to lead, unencumbered by interventions from Shadow Cabinet colleagues, especially as the Coalition builds out a policy platform for the 2028 election,” he said.

“I am grateful for the opportunity to have served as the Shadow Home Affairs Minister, and I wish Sussan and the Shadow Cabinet every success in this term.”

Some conservatives in the Liberal Party see Mr Hastie’s resignation as a first step to take the leadership away from Ms Ley.

It comes days after Mr Hastie posted on social media about wanting to make major cuts to migration.

In a video, Mr Hastie said Autralia needed to “make things here again” and pursue an “Australia first” mentality.

His recent vow to quit the frontbench should the Coalition adopt a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 also caused division in his party.

Mr Hastie was elected in 2015 at a by-election following the death of Canning MP Don Randall.

Since then, he has been a prominent member of the Liberals’ conservative side.

365790946,Warning as measles outbreak grows,"Six of WA’s most recent cases were detected in the Pilbara region, with new exposure sites identified in suburbs around Port Headland and Karratha between September 20 and 29.

The Department of Health advised residents and travellers to check the exposure locations on health.wa.gov.au and watch for symptoms if they attended the spot at the listed dates and times.

Communicable Disease Control Directorate director Paul Armstrong said measles typically developed around 10 days after being exposed to the virus, but this could vary from seven to 18 days. 

“Measles is highly infectious and can spread via airborne droplets to people close by, for example, in waiting rooms,” he said.

“Droplets in the air may still infect people entering a room up to 30 minutes after an infected person has left it.”

 A Health Department spokesman said ﻿early symptoms include fever, tiredness, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed by a florid red non-itchy rash three or four days later.

“The rash usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body,” a spokesman said.

“Anyone experiencing measles symptoms should be tested immediately, particularly residents and travellers in the Pilbara. 

“People with measles are infectious for several days before and after the onset of the rash.”

Authorities warned several countries around the world were experiencing measles outbreaks and people travelling to those countries were at risk if they did not have immunity to the virus.

Authorities urged anyone concerned they or a family member may have measles to seek medical advice by contacting Healthdirect on 1800 022 222 or their GP or emergency department before attending.

Free MMR vaccines are available to people susceptible to measles, even if they are not eligible for Medicare.","Health authorities have confirmed new measles cases in WA’s mining heartland, with the number of infections rising to 45 this year.",https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/measles-outbreak-grows-in-was-mining-heartland-with-new-cases-confirmed/news-story/057a17d6039a78100310534c4e3f3c80?from=rss-basic,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9ad40b47e5a9a1217c718bcf40bfaae1,,2025-10-03 09:28:03,Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp,['Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp'],en,au,-0.764,
365790942,Warning on new home loan scheme,"The scheme was introduced to help first home buyers enter the market with a five per cent deposit and no mortgage lenders insurance to reduce upfront costs.

But finance experts have warned entering the market with a small deposit and 95 per cent home loan would increase mortgage repayments.

Cotality head of research Eliza Owen told Sunrise the monthly repayment on a $950,000 home loan with a five per cent deposit would be $5394 based on a 5.5 per cent mortgage rate.

She said a 20 per cent deposit of $200,000 would reduce mortgage repayments to $4500 per month based on the same rate.

A first homebuyer with a five per cent deposit would pay an additional $10,728 more in mortgage repayments over the course of year in that scenario.

“The important thing for first home buyers to remember is the flip side of a five per cent deposit, is a 95 per cent home loan,” she told Sunrise.

Ms Owen said the scheme would benefit people who were paying sky high rent, and home loan repayments could equal rent paid over five years.

She said rental payments of $800 per week over five years amounted to $200,000.

“It can still work out in your favour, if you are going to be in the private rental market for five years or more in Sydney,” she said.

365818230,Cuba’s leaders see their options dim amid blackouts and a shrinking economy,"The lights went out in Cuba again.

For the fifth time in a year, all of Cuba plunged into darkness on Sept. 10, 2025. Even critical emergency services like hospitals suffered during the nearly 24-hour power outage.

That’s because Cuba’s power grid is old and hard to maintain, and the country cannot afford to import all the oil it needs to keep the lights on.

As a scholar of Cuban society and politics, I believe that the ongoing blackouts point to larger economic problems facing the country. While much of that is due to the continuing effects of the U.S. embargo, which since 1960 has obstructed American trade and tourism with the Caribbean island, Cuba’s leaders also deserve a share of the blame for their economic mismanagement.

Indeed, while other nominally communist countries, such as Vietnam and China, have facilitated the development of a private sphere in their economies in the past several decades, officials in Havana have in practice restricted such growth so as not to threaten state enterprises. 

The result has been a less vibrant, less productive network of private enterprises unable to provide the economic growth that Cuba so desperately needs. All the while, Cuba’s communist government faces an existential threat as it struggles to maintain power in the face of popular discontent. 

The external factors of the crisis

Since 2020, Cuba’s gross domestic product has shrunk by almost 11%, with economists forecasting a further decline of 1%-2% in 2025.

There are a number of reasons for this decline. 

Tourism, Cuba’s lifeblood, has not rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Venezuela, which subsidized Cuba for a decade in the 2000s, particularly with oil exports, no longer has the capacity to do so. Further, persistent energy shortages in Cuba have led to steep declines in agricultural and industrial production. 

From a broader perspective, the U.S. embargo also continues to harm the Cuban economy. For more than 60 years, Cubans have been unable to sell their products to the United States – and Americans have been unable to travel to or do business with Cuba outside of very limited categories.

Estimates vary as to what extent the embargo damages the Cuban economy, but it seems certain that the “blockade,” as Cubans call it, deprives the nation of at least hundreds of millions, if not billions, of U.S. dollars in trade every year, most particularly in agriculture and tourism. 

Steps toward domestic reform

While external factors have taken a toll, the persistent economic difficulties facing Cubans are also self-inflicted by the government.

Cuba’s leaders have pursued a slow, narrow and sometimes arbitrary path toward economic privatization – especially when contrasted with other officially communist countries in Asia.

Following Fidel Castro’s departure from public life in 2008, Cuba’s subsequent leader, and Fidel’s brother, Raul Castro, announced a series of gradual steps intended to encourage private enterprise that had long been curtailed by the government.

Under Raul, the state allowed Cubans to own, buy and sell their homes; they could also create their own businesses, and even employ others to whom they were not related – practices prohibited under Fidel Castro.

The government also allowed more foreigners to invest in Cuba, principally in tourist infrastructure, provided they confined themselves to minority stakes.

Cubans were also permitted for the first time in decades to own their own land, grow food and sell it at markets, setting their own prices within limits. Collective farms, the bane of Soviet agriculture that had once inspired Fidel’s revolutionary visions, were no longer the norm.

By 2017, about 13% of the workforce held licenses to start businesses, while the private sector employed about one-third of all workers.

In the years immediately following these reforms, Cuba posted some gains in industrial and food production and GDP. Indeed, during the mid-2000s, Cuba posted impressive growth rates, sometimes in excess of 10%.

Domestic progress stalled

Unfortunately for Cubans, the upward trend did not continue.

And that is in no small measure due to Cuba’s prosperity in the 2000s being built on Venezuelan subsidies, not by Cuban entrepreneurs.

Venezuela’s late president, and longtime Castro admirer, Hugo Chavez, began to subsidize Fidel Castro’s government shortly after taking power in 1999.

A petrostate, Venezuela provided much-needed oil to Cuba on favorable terms, while also paying the Cuban nation for doctors to work in Venezuela’s hospitals and clinics, providing Cuba with the hard currency it needed to pay for imports.

Researchers estimate that the Venezuelan government subsidized the Cuban economy by as much as US$9 billion per year until 2016.

Venezuelan oil allowed Cuba to paper over a starker reality: Despite reforms, Cuba’s entrepreneurs remained hamstrung by a cumbersome and often corrupt state policy.

Thanks to ever-changing regulations, the majority of private businesses have remained small and dedicated to personal services, such as restaurants, hairdressing, seamstressing and repairs.

On a larger scale, Cuba’s state bureaucrats see competition with government-owned businesses, especially in tourism, as a threat to their power and privileges. Taxes also remain inequitably high for private firms.

Meanwhile, the larger private businesses that are now occasionally permitted are almost always, according to a number of my Cuban-based sources, connected to friends or family members of the political elite, not average Cubans.

There have been successes, to be sure. The private sector now accounts for more retail sales by volume than state enterprises.

But the percentage of the workforce employed by the private sector remains about what it was in 2019, while private enterprise accounts for only about 15% of Cuba’s GDP.

The unsustainable present

Confronting multiple crises, Cuba’s leaders continue to blame the U.S. embargo and policy from Washington that has become only more bellicose under President Donald Trump. No doubt drawing optimism from having weathered severe crises before, the Cuban government seems committed to a state of defiance.

But the evidence this time around suggests Havana’s leaders should be less sanguine.

Despite increasing costs, Cubans enjoy widespread access to [the internet] and they know just how bad and how inequitable things are. 

For all the government’s rhetoric and commitment to a decades-old revolution, Cubans see a much-vaunted medical system that is failing, unable to provide drugs, procedures — or even electricity. They know that crime is on the rise, while inflation reduces the value of the Cuban peso relative to the dollar every week

Cubans see and hear of their well-connected countrymen, with links to state enterprises, flaunting their wealth. Cubans may also know that their military holds as much as US$18 billion abroad — about 16% of Cuba’s GDP in 2024.

What they certainly know and experience is the reality of being forced to live without power, with no possibility of improvement in sight. 

Limited choices going forward

Historically, Cuba has been pulled from crises by foreign patrons willing to subsidize its revolution.

But Russia’s strategic position, China’s global priorities and Venezuela’s hardships all make that unlikely right now. And with the U.S. now pursuing a policy of maximum pressure against noncompliant governments in Latin America, Havana can rest assured that it will see little breathing room from its powerful neighbor and long-time antagonist. 

That leaves the Cuban government with only a few options.

It could choose to continue trying to restrict its citizens’ access to the internet. Unfortunately for the state, the internet is the lifeblood of the private sector. 

Cuba’s leaders could also choose to rely on the loyalty of its security forces and their ability to intimidate and abuse their fellow Cubans. That has worked in the past, but given Havana’s scarce resources and its limited capacity to reward its henchmen, it is not clear that the government can afford to adopt this approach indefinitely. 

Of course, Cuba’s leaders could take steps toward further reform the private sector and eliminate the waste and corruption that have increasingly defined the Cuban state.

Such a course would require the government to permit all Cubans, not just a well-connected few, to compete with state enterprises. It would also mean allowing for a greater degree of foreign investment, which has remained stunted due to government policy. 

If the past offers any guide, however, Havana will instead continue to rely on its formidable security apparatus to repress is citizens, while privatizing in ways that do not threaten the power and privileges of the elite.","Aside from the weight of US policy, the Cuban state has become increasingly sclerotic and unable to meet the growing demands of its population.",https://theconversation.com/cubas-leaders-see-their-options-dim-amid-blackouts-and-a-shrinking-economy-266203,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694176/original/file-20251002-66-ttncb9.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C468%2C3500%2C1750&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,,2025-10-03 09:19:42,"Appalachian State University,Associate Professor of Global Studies,Joseph J.

365786984,‘As much as 10 years’: Diddy jail shock,"After all, his conviction in July on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution – in relation to his now notorious “freak off” sex parties – was seen by his legal team as a partial victory given he was found not guilty on heftier charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. 

But the 55-year-old star could be wishing upon a star if he thinks freedom is close, two US legal experts have told news.com.au.

And there has been a huge clue from the judge that the singer and producer will be sent back to prison come Friday evening. 

Combs could potentially be looking at a sentence of several years, maybe as many as 10, as the judge is able to take into account the evidence against the man seen by some as a “monster” because of what he did to women in his orbit, said one legal scholar. 

However, the real trump card for Combs could be Donald Trump who has floated the possibility of exonerating the star.

On Friday (Saturday morning, AEST) Combs will once again face US District Judge Arun Subramanian at a courthouse in Downtown Manhattan. He is expected, for the first time, to talk to the judge to plead for leniency. 

Combs’ two convictions came after it was proven he had violated the Mann Act which forbids moving sex workers across state lines for paid encounters. Each conviction carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. 

“The 20 years maximum is not at all likely,” Clark Neily, senior vice president for legal studies at US libertarian think tank the Cato Institute, told news.com.au.

“Many federal laws carry outsized maximum sentences that few people, if any, ever receive unless there are truly aggravating circumstances”.

The prosecution has called for a minimum 11 years behind bars while Combs’ defence has said 14 months should suffice – meaning he would be released in a matter of weeks.

But, said Mr Neily, the sheer level of disturbing testimony that was heard in court could lean towards those “aggravating circumstances”. 

“The judge is permitted to consider conduct that the defendant has not been convicted of. There’s a good likelihood he will consider that Combs did what the witnesses said he did, even if that didn't amount to a federal conviction”.

Harrowing evidence

Right at the trial’s outset, Combs’ lawyers said there would be multiple times the jurors might think he was “mean” or a “jerk”. The evidence might prove domestic violence, his team said, but it would not prove any of the federal charges.

The testimony of multiple witnesses certainly lived up to that warning. 

Combs was portrayed as a unrelenting, unreasonable and fearsome boss. Lurid details were given of drug induced sex fuelled marathons – some lasting days – which would see women, including then girlfriend Cassie Ventura, sleep with sex workers while he watched on. Ms Ventura and others insisted they were eventually coerced into sexual degradation.

The vast amounts of baby oil and lube slathered around was eye-opening. But testimony – and video evidence – of Combs beating and threatening women, including Ms Ventura, was heartbreaking. 

While Combs’ lawyers have said his violence should not play a role in his sentencing, the fact is it can and federal prosecutors have said it should as it paints of picture of the man.

“I think it’s pretty likely the judge will (consider this) in this case,” said Mr Neily. 

“The judge could say, ‘I think you threatened these victims and anyone can see this man was something of a monster’. 

“The jury didn’t say Sean Combs is not a bad person, just that the case was more complex than that,” he said referring to the two charges he was found not guilty of.

Up to 10 years jail time

Mr Neily said it was “unlikely” Combs would be incarcerated for 15 – 20 years “but my gut is it could be between four and 10 years”.

Trial lawyer and former felony prosecutor Eric Faddis told news.com.au there was a big clue that Combs wouldn’t be released on Friday

“The fact that the judge has repeatedly denied release pending sentencing tells me the judge is unlikely to (sentence Combs for the same amount as time served).”

Indeed, the I’ll Be Missing You singer has already had a shot this week at instant release turned down. 

On Tuesday, Judge Subramanian denied a bid from Combs’ legal team to toss his convictions.

“I think a sentence requiring additional prison time is reasonably likely, though I don’t see it being as long as the 11 years the prosecution is requesting.”

Mr Faddis thought a sentence of three years was more likely, which would see Combs released in 2027 with time already spent. 

Prosecution ‘over promised, under delivered’

But Mr Faddis, the founding partner of Colorado based legal firm Varner Faddis, said he doubted it would be much more than a few years.

“While Cassie Ventura said she was traumatised and is afraid of what Diddy might do if he is released, Diddy also has a very limited criminal history and the actions underlying his convictions are comparable to state-level prostitution charges — not terribly serious compared to most federal convictions”.

He said the prosecution “over-promised and underdelivered” during the trial. 

“The jury was primed for Caligula-esque orgies and abject sexual servitude and that’s just not what the evidence showed. 

“I think the jury saw these acts and relationships as complicated and at times abusive, but which fell short of human trafficking and mafia-level racketeering.”

Mr Faddis said texts from the alleged victims to Combs, some gushing and sent after alleged freak off sessions, were more “mixed and nuanced” than might be expected in a classic sex trafficking case. 

“I think it was hard for the jury to square those texts with the charges of forced sexual servitude.”

Trump wildcard

A possible ace up Combs’ sleeve is the current US president. Donald Trump who is well within his power to free the star given he has been convicted of federal crimes.

The pair moved in similar circles from the 1990s to 2000s and used to call one another “friends”. But that friendship went downhill when Combs objected to Mr Trump’s political 

Mr Trump has said he would “certainly look at the facts” when considering a pardon for Combs. 

There’s another factor at play too. A key member of the federal team that prosecuted Combs was Maurene Comey. She is the daughter of former FBI director and Trump foe James Comey who has now been indicted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in what many have seen as a highly politicised move. 

Ms Comey was sacked by the DOJ from her government role shortly after the Combs trial concluded. She is now suing the Trump administration claiming “politically motivated termination”.

Exonerating Combs would allow Mr Trump to dismiss all Ms Comey’s hard work on convicting him.

Talking to US news station Newsmax in August, the US president said Combs was “I guess, half innocent”.

Pardoning him, however was “more difficult,” he said. But not because Mr Trump thought Combs deserved to spend more time in jail. No, because Combs made some “terrible statements” about him in the past. 

Asked if his answer to pardon was “more likely a no,” Mr Trump replied “I would say so”.

Many MAGA commentators have urged Mr Trump not to free Combs. To do so, they say, would look like protecting the rich convicted of odious crimes. That’s not a good look when there are loud calls to release the Epstein files. 

But it was hardly the firmest of “nos”. The famously mercurial Mr Trump could yet change his mind.

The social media posts are said to have implied Ms MacInnes had lied when denying she made a complaint about one of the film’s producers, Amanda Ghost, allegedly sexually harassing her or engaging in other unacceptable behaviour that made her feel uncomfortable, documents released by the court and seen by NewsWire claim.

“lol OK this one will be fun”

The posts also allegedly implied Ms MacInnes had “changed her story” about the alleged complaint in return for a lead role in another of Ms Ghost’s productions, as well as a record deal.

The documents claim the imputations are “false and seriously defamatory”, harming Ms MacInnes’ reputation at a critical point in her career.

Fresh allegations that Ms Wilson requested that her publicist create a “series of malicious websites” about Ms Ghost were detailed in a statement of claim released by the Federal Court and seen by NewsWire.

365786982,‘Quite bad’: Isla addresses divorce,"Fisher and the UK comedian finalised their $245 million divorce in June, and Baron Cohen has since been seen hanging out with a much younger influencer. 

In a new interview, Fisher has called the split one of the hardest personal struggles she has ever had to face in her life. 

“It’s the most difficult thing I’ve been through,” she told WISH. 

Despite having her personal trauma to deal with, Fisher has worked hard to focus on the positive in life, and it’s helped her fall back in love with acting. 

“I’ve really enjoyed going back to work,” she excitedly shared. “It’s so exciting to focus your energy back on something. It’s not that I fell out of love with being ambitious or working, it’s just that I was more in love with motherhood, and I still am.”

Fisher said that she feels grateful to be at a point where she’s able to change the trajectory of the “last act of her life”. 

“It’s amazing to me that at this point in my life, I’ve got this opportunity, in a positive way, to reinvent what the last act of my life is now from the ground up. The kind of person that I would want to be with, if I ever wanted to get into another relationship, the kind of work I want to do, and who I want to be around socially, spiritually and emotionally.

“I’ve got time to discover what inspires me creatively, so it’s been an amazing and lucky thing. For most parents, we focus on our kids, and it’s so divine and magical and so absorbing, but now I have some time where the kids aren’t with me, so I get some time to think about what the future might hold for me, which is exciting and also scary. Everything is scary.”

Going through a very public split at a time when she’s also been battling an addiction to social media has been tough for the Aussie star, who intends to take a step back from it all.

365795356,Breaking: Andrew Hastie quits shadow cabinet,"Shadow Home Affairs Minister and Liberal leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie has quit Sussan Ley's shadow ministry.

In a statement Mr Hastie said he had informed Ms Ley this morning.

""The leader has made it clear that the Shadow Home Affairs Minister won't lead the Coalition's response to immigration matters or develop the Coalition's immigration strategy,"" he said.

""On this basis, I made the decision that I was not able to continue in this role and remain silent on immigration.""

""Out of respect for Sussan's leadership, I am resigning from the front bench ... Sussan deserves to lead unencumbered by interventions from shadow cabinet colleagues.""

Mr Hastie said it was a well established convention that if a member of the shadow cabinet was ""unwilling to live by the convention of solidarity"" they must depart to the backbench.

He expressed his gratitude to Ms Ley and wished her ""every success"" as leader.

In a statement, Ms Ley said she sent out 'charter letters' three days ago to shadow ministers laying out her expectations for the Coalition.

""They enable the Coalition to develop a serious and credible policy platform to take to the next election, where we will draw a clear contrast with Labor,"" Ms Ley said.

""These letters were developed in extensive consultation with individual members of the shadow ministry and were the product of more than 50 one-on-one conversations between me and my team, including with Andrew Hastie.""

Today, Mr Hastie informed me via telephone, that he would be unable to comply with this longstanding and well-understood requirement, and on that basis he would be resigning his position as Shadow Minister for Home Affairs. Mr Hastie did not raise any matters relating to policy on this call.""

Ms Ley said she had thanked Mr Hastie for his ""service"", and formal changes to the shadow ministry would be announced shortly.

“There are great commonalities between nursing and being a priest. It’s all about people, and sitting with people during the most difficult times in their lives,” she once told a magazine.

Reflecting the Church of England’s status as England’s established church, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office announced the decision with the formal consent of King Charles.

As monarch, Charles is the supreme governor of the Church of England, a role established in the 16th century when King Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church.

365814942,Israeli military intercepts last flotilla boat sailing to Gaza,"The final boat in a global flotilla bound for Gaza, with an Australian man on board, has been intercepted by Israeli military.

More than 40 boats carrying hundreds of activists had been taking a symbolic amount of aid to the war-torn city when the boats were intercepted by Israeli soldiers in international waters, about 80 nautical miles from Gaza, on Thursday.

One boat with six people on board, the Marinette, evaded the IDF until Friday afternoon AEDT, when a live stream showed Israeli soldiers surround and board the boat, calling for crew to put their hands in the air.

Crew members held up signs in front of the live camera aboard the ship saying they spotted 'war ships' approaching, shortly before Israeli soldiers boarded the vessel. 

Australian man Cameron Tribe had been aboard the boat, and had posted to social media on Friday that his was ""the last boat standing"", and had sailed alone through the night.

Five Australians detained

Five other Australians in the Global Sumud Flotilla were detained on Thursday, including GP Dr Bianca Webb-Pullman, Sydney content maker Abubakir Rafiq, filmmaker Juliet Lamont, Hamish Peterson and Surya McEwen.

In a statement, a spokesperson for DFAT said it was sending officials to Ketziot, a prison in the southern Israeli desert, ""to provide consular assistance to any Australian who requests it"".

""They are liaising with Israeli authorities and have formally requested confirmation of the detention of any Australians,"" the statement said

The prison, in southern Israel, will likely hold the detainees until they agree to sign deportation papers or are forcibly deported.

Mr Rafiq's brother, Hudayfa Rafiq, said his family was concerned about Australians being taken to prison and called on the Australian government to act on behalf of its citizens.

""We are worried for the wellbeing of my brother, as well as the other Australians,"" he said.

The flotilla was carrying around 500 activists from dozens of countries, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.

Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has called on the federal government to do everything in its power to secure the release of Australians on board the aid flotilla to Gaza.

The DFAT spokesperson said it had ""warned against attempts to breach the naval blockade and strongly advised Australians not to do so because of the risks to their safety"".

365814944,A track-by-track look at Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl,"Taylor Swift has released her 12th studio album, and despite fears that her love life would result in music that is somewhat less spirited, The Life of a Showgirl is not a romantic album.

Swift, who announced her engagement to Kansas City Chiefs NFL player Travis Kelce on social media, has delivered an album that's instead described as ""fun"", but not as poetic as her previous outings.

Fan culture researcher Georgia Carroll says, however, that the beats and the production on the album almost make you forget that the lyrics aren't up to scratch.

Swift announced the new release on her fiancé's podcast.

There will be cinema release parties from 5am AEST on Saturday. Global audiences are promised a look at the music video for the first track on the album, as well as behind-the scenes footage, in addition to Swift's personal reflections.

Till then, Dr Carroll has taken ABC News on a track-by-track journey through the album.

The Fate of Ophelia

This is a frozen Daiquiri on a hot day, despite the title being a nod to a tragic character from Shakespeare's Hamlet.

Dr Carroll says Swift is good at pairing upbeat sounds with moody lyrics.

""Because you listen on the first go and you get the beats and you're like, 'oh, this is great' or, 'I'm not sure about this', and then you go back and you're like 'oh, wow, now I know what she's saying. This adds layers to it.""

Dr Carroll says the song sounds fun, despite having dark undertones, and is a good start to the album.

""From the very beginning, I was like, 'oh, yeah, I'm into this'.""

Elizabeth Taylor

It isn't new to name a track after someone famous (think Elon Musk by DDG featuring Gunna, and there are many songs named after Elizabeth Taylor).

It's also not the first time Swift has name-dropped Taylor, despite her younger fans perhaps not being so privy to the late 1950s Hollywood star.

Dr Carroll says this song is one of the few that play on the album's overall theme.

""But again, I thought it had a good beat and it kind of was really setting the scene for what was to come in the rest of the album.""

Dr Carroll says Opalite is her favourite song on the album, and she's not alone in that.

""I'm a big pop girly, so from first listen, especially the chorus, it is just so upbeat.

""It just makes me want to dance and has that positive vibe.

""But I'm going to need to listen to the lyrics to actually dive down deep.""

Father Figure

This song interpolates George Michael's song of the same name.

""There was rumours about it and then his estate have come out today and said they got permission and they were really happy when they heard it,"" Dr Carroll says.

As for Dr Carroll's interpretation of the song, she believes it's a commentary on buying back the master recordings of her first six albums and staking her claim.

""And it wasn't what I was expecting from the song, but it it makes sense in the context of what her career has been, and obviously the commentary and the powerful men she's had to come up against.

""So, I think it's a creative way of addressing that.""

Eldest Daughter

Dr Carroll says Swift has had better tracks in this position on the album.

""I normally love a Taylor track five,"" Dr Carroll says.

""There is just so much expectation around what her track five is going to be that on two listens, it hasn't lived up to the hype for me.""

Ruin the Friendship

Dr Carroll said there was lots of discussion within the fandom about what Ruin the Friendship was going to be about before the album dropped.

""I don't think anybody was really expecting it to be what could have been a letter to a dead friend from high school and it it does take that kind of turn two-thirds of the way with the reveal that that's what the song is about,"" she said.

""I found it more emotional and probably maybe even more suited to being a track five than Eldest Daughter was.""

Dr Carroll wonders whether it really fits on The Life of a Showgirl. The broader narrative of the album was written during Swift's Eras tour and while she was falling in love with Kelce.

""But I think it fits into her wider discography and that kind of the storytelling and the weaving in things about her personal life quite well,"" she said.

Actually Romantic

Ahead of the release, there was speculation that this was a Charli XCX diss track, after the lyrics were leaked.

Dr Carroll says a diss track for Swift is nothing new.

""She's done a lot of these kind of songs before where she's just kind of poking at the general bigger enemy, whether they're people we know about, whether it's critics, whether it's faceless people on the Internet, she's done diss tracks to an extent before,"" she said.

""It's already created discourse.

""Musically, I think it's a very fun song and it's clear that some of it is a bit tongue-in-cheek and I think it has a really interesting sound that again, I maybe wasn't expecting on the album.

""But after reading the lyrics and being a bit worried about what it would be, I was pleasantly surprised when I actually got to it on the album.""

Wi$h Li$t is Dr Carroll's least favourite on the album, but she says lyrically it tells fans the most about Swift and Kelce's relationship.

""It tells us a lot about where she's at in that stage of her life,"" she says.

""[Swift is] talking about wanting kids with Travis and kind of having that white picket fence life.

""It's the song I think that comes closest to what we in a lot of ways thought we were going to get a whole album of, that kind of 'I'm so happy and in love'.

Dr Carroll says parents should pre-screen Wood before letting their little Swift fans listen to it.

""It is innuendo central,"" Dr Carroll says.

The next song is about people in Swift's camp being cancelled.

""People are saying it's possibly about Blake Lively,"" Dr Carroll says.

Lively is caught up in a legal battle with It Ends With us co-star, Justin Baldoni.

""But kind of like Actually Romantic, I think the Blake situation may have sparked part of it,"" Dr Carroll said.

""But I think it's also more broadly about how women and celebrities are treated and how people rightfully do get cancelled and a lot of people should be cancelled, but we do often just attack people for relatively harmless missteps.""

Dr Carroll says the song is reminiscent of a track you might find on Swift's 2017 album Reputation.

Dr Carroll says Honey ""faded into the album"".

""I thought Honey was cute,"" she said.

""I thought it had a nice beat.

""But it stuck with me less than some of the other songs.""

The Life of a Showgirl (feat. Sabrina Carpenter)

This is the only song on the album with a feature. Sabrina Carpenter, who joined Swift on the Eras tour, gets her ""own time to shine"" on the album.

""I thought the use of the vocals from the Eras tour at the end was the perfect way to finish.

""And I would love it to be one of the other singles that she uses because I just thought it was fun.

""Sabrina was great, and it encapsulated the vibe of the album.""","Taylor Swift's new album The Life of a Showgirl will be deconstructed by critics and fans alike, probably for some time to come.

365793514,Canberra prison volleyball game ends in inmate’s ear being bitten off,"A jailhouse volleyball match in Canberra turned violent when an inmate bit off another prisoner’s ear, earning him extra time behind bars.

Benjamin John Wickes, 33, pleaded guilty in the ACT Supreme Court to causing grievous bodily harm and choking his fellow inmate after the volleyball game ended.

The incident took place at Canberra’s only correctional centre, the Alexander Maconochie Centre on June 25.

The two prisoners were playing volleyball on opposing sides with several other detainees when they exchanged words at the end of the game.

Wickes went under the net and approached the other prisoner before they exchanged punches and fell to the ground.

“(Wickes) bit down on the victim’s ear with sufficient force to bite off a chunk of it … then spat out the part of victim’s ear that he had bitten off,” Justice Verity McWilliam said.

The court was told Wickes continued to hit the victim, gouged his eyes with his fingers then put him in a chokehold so he could breathe when he tried to get up.

Justice McWilliam said given the incident occurred during a team sporting game it was an opportunistic attack rather than premeditated, but there was high degree of violence.

“The consequence was severe in terms of a loss of a body part,” she said.

The court was told Wickes had a disadvantaged upbringing and deserved support to overcome his challenges, but had showed no remorse towards his victim after the attack.

He was sentenced to one year, five months and five days, with a non-parole period of six months and 19 days.

The sentence will be served partially concurrent with his existing sentence, meaning he will be eligible for parole on November 19.",A prisoner will spend more time behind bars after he bit off another inmate’s ear during a volleyball game.,https://thewest.com.au/lifestyle/canberra-prison-volleyball-game-ends-in-inmates-ear-being-bitten-off-c-20228316,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20228316/30132a9a3f05eab6e990f3379faa7ce6b1b6fae3-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-10-03 09:12:27,Emma Kirk,['Emma Kirk'],en,au,-0.337,

365818228,Birds all over the world use the same sound to warn of threats,"Language enables us to connect with each other and coordinate to achieve incredible feats. Our ability to communicate abstract concepts is often seen as a defining feature of our species, and one that separates us from the rest of life on Earth. 

This is because while the ability to pair an arbitrary sound with a specific meaning is widespread in human language, it is rarely seen in other animal communication systems. Several recent studies have shown that birds, chimpanzees, dolphins, and elephants also do it. But how such a capacity emerges remains a mystery.

While language is characterised by the widespread use of sounds that have a learned association with the item they refer to, humans and animals also produce instinctive sounds. For example, a scream made in response to pain. Over 150 years ago, naturalist Charles Darwin suggested the use of these instinctive sounds in a new context could be an important step in the development of language-like communication.

In our new study, published today in Nature Ecology and Evolution, we describe the first example of an animal vocalisation that contains both instinctive and learned features – similar to the stepping stone Darwin envisioned. 

A unique call towards a unique threat

Birds have a variety of enemies, but brood parasites are unique. 

Brood parasites, such as cuckoos, are birds that reproduce by laying their egg in the nest of another species and manipulating the unsuspecting host to incubate their egg and raise their offspring. The first thing a baby cuckoo does after it hatches is heave the other baby birds out of the nest, claiming the effort of its unsuspecting foster parents all to itself. 

The high cost of brood parasitism makes it an excellent study system to explore how evolution works in the wild. 

For example, our past work has shown that in Australia, the superb fairy-wren has evolved a unique call it makes when it sees a cuckoo. When other fairy-wrens hear this alarm call, they quickly come in and attack the cuckoo. 

During these earlier experiments, we couldn’t help but notice other species were responding to this call and making a very similar call themselves. What’s more, discussions with collaborators who were working in countries as far away as China, India and Sweden suggested the birds there were also making a very similar call – and also only towards cuckoos. 

Birds from around the world use the same call

First, we explored online wildlife media databases to see if there were other examples of this call towards brood parasites. We found 21 species that produce this call towards their brood parasites, including cuckoos and parasitic finches. Some of these birds were closely related and lived nearby each other, but others shared a last common ancestor over 50 million years ago and live on different continents. 

For example, this is a superb fairy-wren responding to a shining bronze-cuckoo in Australia.

And this is a tawny-flanked prinia responding to a cuckoo finch in Zambia.

As vocalisations exist to communicate information, we suspected this call either functioned to attract the attention of their own or other species. 

To compare these possibilities, we used a known database of the world’s brood parasites and hosts. If this call exists to communicate information within a species, we expected the species that produce it should be more cooperative, because more birds are better at defending their nest. 

We did not find this. Instead, we found that species that produce this call exist in areas with more brood parasites and hosts, suggesting it exists to enable cooperation across different species that are targeted by brood parasites.

Communicating across species to defend against a common threat

To test whether these calls were produced uniquely towards cuckoos in multiple species, we conducted experiments in Australia. 

When we presented superb fairy-wrens or white-browed scrubwrens with a taxidermied cuckoo, they made this call and tried to attack it. By contrast, when they were presented with other taxidermied models, such as a predator, this call was very rarely produced. 

When we presented the fairy-wrens and scrubwrens with recordings of the call, they responded strongly. This suggests both species produce the call almost exclusively towards cuckoos, and when they hear it they respond predictably.

If this call is something like a “universal word” for a brood parasite across birds, we should expect different species to respond equally to hearing it – even when it is produced by a species they have never seen before. We found exactly this: when we played calls from Australia to birds in China (and vice-versa) they responded the same. 

This suggests different species from all around the world use this call because it provides specific information about the presence of a brood parasite.

Insights into the origins of language

Our study suggests that over 20 species of birds from all around the world that are separated by over 50 million years of evolution use the same call when they see their respective brood parasite species. 

This is fascinating in and of itself. But while these birds know how to respond to the call, our past work has shown that birds that have never seen a cuckoo do not produce this call, but they do after watching others produce it when there is a cuckoo nearby. 

In other words, while the response to the call is instinctive, producing the call itself is learned. 

Whereas vocalisations are normally either instinctive or learned, this is the first example of an animal vocalisation across species that has both instinctive and learned components. This is important, because it appears to represent a midpoint between the types of vocalisations that are common in animal communication systems and human language. 

So, Darwin may have been right about language all along.",The findings of a new study about communication between birds also offer key insights into the origins of language.,https://theconversation.com/birds-all-over-the-world-use-the-same-sound-to-warn-of-threats-266618,https://images.theconversation.com/files/694242/original/file-20251003-56-5sec6z.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C308%2C3509%2C1754&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,,2025-10-03 09:00:17,"Cornell Lab of Ornithology,Cornell University; Niki Teunissen,Environmental Futures Research Institute,Griffith University; Estación Biológica de Doñana EBD-CSIC; James Kennerley,Monash University,Postdoctoral Fellow,Postdoctoral research fellow,Research fellow,William Feeney","['Cornell Lab of Ornithology', 'Cornell University; Niki Teunissen', 'Environmental Futures Research Institute', 'Griffith University; Estación Biológica de Doñana EBD-CSIC; James Kennerley', 'Monash University', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Postdoctoral research fellow', 'Research fellow', 'William Feeney']",en,AU,0.366,
365793492,"When snow leopards in her care got sick, Lily was out for blood","Several years ago, in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr Lily Parkinson, who was working as an emergency and critical care veterinarian at the University of Georgia, began getting calls about snow leopards. By then, the coronavirus had jumped into a variety of zoo animals, but snow leopards seemed to be getting unusually ill. Some were developing severe anaemia, a shortage of red blood cells that can leave the body critically short of oxygen.

Had the patients been human or even domesticated cats, treatment would have been routine: a transfusion of red blood cells from an established blood bank.

But there were no blood banks for snow leopards, and veterinarians knew little about blood types and compatibility in exotic animals. So zoos scrambled to find suitable blood donors. Institutions with healthy snow leopards offered to sedate their animals, draw their blood and send it to Parkinson, who just happened to be in the middle of a research project on blood types in large, wild cat species.

But the logistical challenges were enormous and, in many cases, insurmountable. The zoo employees who were needed to collect the blood were out sick. Samples were lost in the mail. “Other zoos that really wanted to donate and help were just not able to drop everything that they already had on their schedule,” Parkinson says.

The health of some leopards deteriorated so fast that they had to be euthanised before transfusions could be arranged.

Today, Parkinson, now a clinical veterinarian at Brookfield Zoo Chicago, is trying to lay the groundwork for a resource that might have given some of these animals a chance: a blood bank for zoos and aquariums, stocked with pre-screened blood from a menagerie of exotic animals.

To make this possible, she is drawing on techniques in human medicine that allow delicate red blood cells to be preserved, on ice, for years. If she can do the same thing for polar bears, pangolins, dolphins and dik-diks, it could leave zoos far better prepared for future animal health emergencies. “We could theoretically try to bank every animal that we have in zoos and have it frozen and ready,” she says.","In a bid to save some of the world’s most exotic animals in times of emergency, a US vet is developing a blood bank for zoos that covers a menagerie of species.",https://www.theage.com.au/national/when-snow-leopards-in-her-care-got-sick-lily-was-out-for-blood-20250923-p5mx7w.html,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027547369626195%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_103%2C$y_61/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/532400ea160b2ef3029dd269872d7c23b3527843,,2025-10-03 09:00:00,Emily Anthes,['Emily Anthes'],en,au,-0.278,

365792422,"When snow leopards in her care got sick, Lily was out for blood","Several years ago, in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr Lily Parkinson, who was working as an emergency and critical care veterinarian at the University of Georgia, began getting calls about snow leopards. By then, the coronavirus had jumped into a variety of zoo animals, but snow leopards seemed to be getting unusually ill. Some were developing severe anaemia, a shortage of red blood cells that can leave the body critically short of oxygen.

Had the patients been human or even domesticated cats, treatment would have been routine: a transfusion of red blood cells from an established blood bank.

But there were no blood banks for snow leopards, and veterinarians knew little about blood types and compatibility in exotic animals. So zoos scrambled to find suitable blood donors. Institutions with healthy snow leopards offered to sedate their animals, draw their blood and send it to Parkinson, who just happened to be in the middle of a research project on blood types in large, wild cat species.

But the logistical challenges were enormous and, in many cases, insurmountable. The zoo employees who were needed to collect the blood were out sick. Samples were lost in the mail. “Other zoos that really wanted to donate and help were just not able to drop everything that they already had on their schedule,” Parkinson says.

The health of some leopards deteriorated so fast that they had to be euthanised before transfusions could be arranged.

365787920,Hamas Says Still Needs Time To Study Trump's Gaza Plan,"A Hamas official told AFP on Friday that the group still needed time to study a plan put forward by US President Donald Trump to end nearly two years of devastating war in Gaza.The proposal, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages within 72 hours, Hamas's disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.That would be followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself.""Hamas is still continuing consultations regarding Trump's plan... and has informed mediators that the consultations are ongoing and need some time,"" the official said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. Trump on Tuesday gave Hamas an ultimatum of ""three or four days"" to accept his plan, which has been welcomed by world powers, including Arab and Muslim nations.Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas's political bureau, said in a statement Friday that the ""plan has points of concern, and we will announce our position on it soon.""""We are in contact with mediators and with Arab and Islamic parties, and we are serious about reaching understandings,"" he added.On the ground on Friday, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency -- a rescue force operating under Hamas authority -- reported heavy air bombardment and artillery shelling on Gaza City.The Israeli military has for weeks been waging an air and ground offensive on the territory's largest urban centre, from where hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee.Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP cannot independently verify details or casualty figures provided by the Israeli military or the civil defence.Adnan Abu Hasna, a media adviser for the UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA, described the situation in Gaza as ""catastrophic,"" with Palestinians forced into repeated rounds of displacement and where ""access to food and water remains limited.""As the war nears the two-year mark and the death toll and destruction continues to rise, protesters around the world have in recent days railed at Israel's interception of a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for Gaza.On Friday, the organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said its last remaining boat had been intercepted some 40 nautical miles from Gaza.As Hamas mulled Trump's peace plan this week, a Palestinian source close to the group's leadership told AFP on Wednesday that the Islamist movement ""wants to amend some of the clauses such as the one on disarmament and the expulsion of Hamas and faction cadres.""Hamas leaders also want ""international guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip"" and guarantees that no assassinations attempts will be made inside or outside the territory, the source added.Another source familiar with the negotiations told AFP that the group was split over Trump's plan.Structurally, the group's leadership is divided between officials based in the Gaza Strip and those abroad, particularly in Qatar -- which has acted as a key mediator with Egypt and the United States throughout the war.Much of the Hamas's leadership has been wiped out in Israeli attacks throughout the war.The source close to the group's leadership said that ""two opinions exist within Hamas"".""The first supports unconditional approval, as the priority is a ceasefire under Trump's guarantees, with mediators ensuring Israel implements the plan,"" the source told AFP.""The second has serious reservations regarding key clauses, rejecting disarmament and the expulsion of any Palestinian from Gaza. They favour conditional approval with clarifications reflecting Hamas's and the resistance factions' demands,"" the source added.Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Qatar would pressure Hamas to provide a positive, but ""ultimately it's not just about convincing Hamas leadership in Doha, but also the leadership in Gaza, as well as Hamas members and fighters in Gaza,"" he added.""Additionally, Hamas must then be able to convince other factions in Gaza,"" he added.The war was triggered by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive has devastated killed at least 66,225 Palestinians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory that the United Nations considers reliable.Their data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but indicates that more than half of the dead are women and children.",A Hamas official told AFP on Friday that the group still needed time to study a plan put forward by US President Donald Trump to end nearly two years of devastating war in Gaza.,https://www.ibtimes.com.au/hamas-says-still-needs-time-study-trumps-gaza-plan-1860707,https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1889645/israel-hamas-war-has-devastated-large-swathes-gaza-strip.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3ac21991ed228e3e62150248ed823ad3,,2025-10-03 08:57:07,Afp Team In The Gaza Strip With Alice Chancellor In Jerusalem,['Afp Team In The Gaza Strip With Alice Chancellor In Jerusalem'],en,au,-0.347,politics
365777424,"‘Mirror, Mirror in the Lab’, BRIC-RGCB scientists build tiny nanopores to spot diseases early","Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 3 (IANS) Imagine a microscopic tunnel that can tell whether you might be developing cancer — well, scientists at BRIC-RGCB, Thiruvananthapuram, are turning that imagination into reality.

In a breakthrough study, researchers have created mirror-image nanopores, tiny protein-like channels designed to act like a reflection of natural molecules.

Led by Dr. K.R.Mahendran, the team built these synthetic structures, named DpPorA, from special peptides that are flipped versions of natural proteins.

Computer simulations confirmed that the mirror-image pores are structurally opposite to their natural counterparts — and surprisingly, this “mirror trick” makes them more stable and selective.

Their findings were recently published in Nature Communications.

“These nanopores are like highly selective gates,” explained Dr. Mahendran.

“We can tune them to let certain molecules pass while blocking others. That means we can detect everything from tiny sugar rings to full-size proteins, which opens the door to early detection of diseases and even personalised diagnostics.”

But the innovation doesn’t stop there. Lab tests revealed that these mirror molecules can target and damage cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed — hinting at future therapies that could fight cancer safely.

Prof. Chandrabhas Narayana, RGCB Director, hailed the discovery as a game-changer.

“It has enormous potential — not only in cancer, but also in healing wounds, repairing muscles, and boosting immune function. It could even help tackle neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s,” he said.

The work was a collaborative effort, involving CSIR-NIIST, Thiruvananthapuram, Constructor University, Germany, and the Centre for Human Genetics, Bengaluru.

Funding came from top Indian science bodies, including the Department of Biotechnology, Department of Science and Technology, ICMR, and CSIR.

By combining chemistry, nanotechnology, and cancer biology, this research has created a powerful new tool that could revolutionise medical diagnostics.

These tiny mirror-image pores may one day help detect diseases early, safely, and precisely, transforming the way doctors diagnose and treat illnesses.","Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 3 (IANS) Imagine a microscopic tunnel that can tell whether you might be developing cancer &#8212; well, scientists at BRIC-RGCB, Thiruvananthapuram, are turning that imagination into reality.

365777442,Apple Watch Ultra saves life of 26-year-old Mumbai techie during Scuba diving mishap,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) In yet another incident where technology came to the rescue, an Apple Watch Ultra has saved the life of a 26-year-old Mumbai techie during a scuba diving accident near Puducherry.

The man, Kshitij Zodape, who works with an e-commerce company, was diving this summer when his equipment malfunctioned underwater, putting his life at risk.

Kshitij, who has been diving since 2020, recalled that the waters were choppy with poor visibility, barely 5 to 10 metres.

He had gone about 36 metres deep in the Bay of Bengal when his weight belt suddenly came loose.

This caused him to rise rapidly towards the surface, an ascent that could have been fatal.

“We were around 36 metres down when I suddenly started shooting up towards the surface,” he said.

The Apple Watch Ultra strapped to his wrist sensed the sudden vertical ascent and immediately began showing warnings on its screen, alerting him to slow down as the rapid rise could cause serious lung injuries.

However, Kshitij was unable to stop his uncontrollable ascent. The watch then triggered its emergency siren.

The loud siren, distinct from underwater sounds, alerted his diving instructor, who quickly swam back to assist him.

By then, Kshitij had already risen around 10 metres but was still being pushed upwards due to the buoyancy caused by the missing weight belt.

The intervention, guided by the Apple Watch Ultra’s alarm, helped avert a life-threatening situation.

Kshitij admitted that he did not even know the watch had such a feature. “Before I could even realise, my watch started showing warnings. When I ignored them, it started chiming at full volume. My instructor immediately heard it,” he said.

Kshitij later wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook to share his story. To his surprise, Cook personally responded, writing: “I’m so glad your instructor heard the alarm and quickly assisted you. Thanks so much for sharing your story with us. Be well.”

The Apple Watch Ultra, launched in 2022 as a rugged, adventure-ready device, includes several safety features, including the emergency siren.

The siren emits two alternating high-pitched sounds that can be heard up to 180 metres away, specifically designed to cut through environmental noise in emergencies.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) In yet another incident where technology came to the rescue, an Apple Watch Ultra has saved the life of a 26-year-old Mumbai techie during a&#8230; Continue reading Apple Watch Ultra saves life of 26-year-old Mumbai techie during Scuba diving mishap

365777444,"Mehbooba Mufti says youth ‘rising’ in protests wake-up call for India, Pakistan","Srinagar, Oct 3 (IANS) Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and president of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Mehbooba Mufti said on Friday that youth “were rising in protests” because they are “confronting the raw truth that the system has failed their hopes and aspirations”.

Mufti said on X, “From Uttarakhand to Ladakh & across the border in Kashmir Gen Z is rising. Because when your future feels bleak & your dreams are shattered – resistance knows no borders. These are young people who toiled for a future studied hard, followed every rule and held on to a ray of hope. But now they see the promise of that future slipping away. They aren’t just protesting. They are confronting power with raw truth because the very system they were told to believe in has failed them catastrophically.”

“This isn’t just noise. It’s heartbreak turning into resistance. This is not a rebellion but a cry for survival. They are not asking anymore. They are demanding what’s rightfully theirs – Accountability. Justice. Opportunity. Dignity. It’s a wake up call for our country India, and even neighbouring Pakistan,” she added.

Mufti also posted some videos of protests for ‘Azadi’, which, according to her, is a wake-up call for both India and Pakistan.

The PDP president has been highly critical of both the J&K government headed by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and the Central government headed.

While she joins the chorus with the ruling National Conference (NC) for statehood, for slashing down reservations, etc., she also blames Omar Abdullah for heading what she calls a ‘powerless elected government’.

She severely criticises the BJP and its leaders for their approach to the issues facing the country.

Her father late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, joined hands with the BJP to form a coalition government after the 2014 elections in J&K.

After Sayeed’s death, Mehbooba Mufti continued the ruling coalition with the BJP till the latter decided to pull out of the coalition government in June 2018.

The PDP fought the 2024 Assembly elections and barely managed to win three seats, in contrast to 28 the party had in the 2014 elections in the J&K Assembly.

Many of her former party colleagues/ministers have left the PDP, and Mufti has been, for the last seven years, trying hard to consolidate her party.","Srinagar, Oct 3 (IANS) Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and president of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Mehbooba Mufti said on Friday that youth &#8220;were rising in protests&#8221; because&#8230; Continue reading Mehbooba Mufti says youth &#8216;rising&#8217; in protests wake-up call for India, Pakistan

365777420,Youth’s throat-slit body recovered from Bengal’s Baruipur,"Kolkata, Oct 3 (IANS) A throat-slit body of a youth was recovered beside a wooden pedestrian bridge at Begumpur village panchayat in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal on Friday morning.

The body lying near the wooden pedestrian bridge was first noticed by some passers-by, who informed the local police station, following which the cops came and recovered it.

The identity of the deceased youth is yet to be ascertained.

The local people said that he was not a resident of the village panchayat where his body was recovered.

The police are trying their best to track the identity of the deceased youth to carry forward the investigation.

Initial investigation has hinted that the youth was possibly murdered by slitting his throat, and thereafter his body was dumped beside the wooden pedestrian bridge.

The body of the victim had been sent for post-mortem examination, and the exact reason behind his death could be ascertained after the detailed autopsy report is available.

A broken liquor bottle, a soft-beverage bottle, and a plastic drinking container had been recovered from near the body of the victim. The autopsy report will also indicate whether there was alcohol in the stomach of the victim or not.

“Now, in case the post-mortem report indicates the presence of alcohol in his stomach, the question now is whether the deceased youth was consuming alcohol at the spot before his murder, or if he had companions,” a district police official said.

The investigating officials are also examining footage of CCTV cameras installed in and around the area to get clues in the matter.

The local people have told the cops that the area from where the body was recovered generally becomes secluded after sunset, and taking that advantage, some local anti-social elements chose the place for consuming alcohol.

“The matter had been brought to the notice of the local police station several times. But no concrete action had been taken,” a local villager said.","Kolkata, Oct 3 (IANS) A throat-slit body of a youth was recovered beside a wooden pedestrian bridge at Begumpur village panchayat in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal on&#8230; Continue reading Youth&#8217;s throat-slit body recovered from Bengal&#8217;s Baruipur

365777414,"IAF achieved longest-range kill, left Pakistan paralysed: Air Force Chief on Op Sindoor precision","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) In a powerful assertion of India’s air superiority, India’s Air Marshal revealed that a recent Indian Air Force operation, during ‘Operation Sindoor’, not only penetrated deep into enemy territory but also achieved the longest-range kill to date — till 300 km, leaving Pakistan unable to operate even within its own borders.

Speaking to reporters, Air Marshal A.P. Singh highlighted the strategic success of the mission, stating, “We were able to penetrate deep into enemy territory and execute strikes with high precision.”

He credited India’s robust air defence infrastructure for playing a pivotal role in the overall plan, enabling seamless coordination and protection of assets during the operation.

“We were able to bring them to their knees within one night of intensive operations. The ability of the Air Force to be able to deliver this catastrophic firepower has been shown first time after 1971,” IAF chief Singh said.

The mission, which remains classified in its finer details, reportedly involved the deployment of advanced long-range weapons systems. “Long-range weapons were effectively deployed, and satellite imagery confirmed the hits we achieved,” the Air Marshal said, underscoring the technological edge that India leveraged during the strike.

The operation’s standout achievement was the longest-range kill ever recorded by the Indian Air Force, a milestone that reflects the growing reach and lethality of India’s aerial capabilities.

According to defence analysts, such a kill likely involved precision-guided munitions launched from standoff distances, minimising risk to pilots while maximising impact.

Perhaps most striking was the Air Marshal Singh’s comment on Pakistan’s inability to respond. “Pakistan was unable to operate even within its own territory,” he said, suggesting that the scale and surprise of the operation left the adversary paralysed and disoriented.

The statement marks a significant moment in India’s defence narrative, showcasing not only tactical brilliance but also strategic deterrence.

As regional tensions simmer, the Indian Air Force’s demonstration of reach, precision, and preparedness sends a clear message: India is future-ready and capable of defending its interests with decisive force.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) In a powerful assertion of India’s air superiority, India’s Air Marshal revealed that a recent Indian Air Force operation, during ‘Operation Sindoor’, not only penetrated&#8230; Continue reading IAF achieved longest-range kill, left Pakistan paralysed: Air Force Chief on Op Sindoor precision

365777434,"Stalin calls BJP a parasite exploiting tragedies for poll gains, a washing machine for corrupt","Ramanathapuram (Tamil Nadu), Oct 3 (IANS) Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party, branding it a “parasite” that thrives by exploiting tragedies for electoral gain and labelling it a “washing machine” for corrupt individuals.

Speaking in Ramnathapuram on Friday after unveiling development projects, the Chief Minister lashed out at the Union government, calling its response to the Karur stampede, which left 41 dead, including women and children, an act of political opportunism.

He alleged that Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who failed to visit Tamil Nadu following three major natural disasters, was “now rushing to Karur” solely for scoring political mileage ahead of elections.

“The BJP is like a parasite that survives by sucking the blood of others,” he alleged, adding that the saffron party was depriving Tamil Nadu of its rights and is working against the state’s interests.

He further termed the BJP a “washing machine” for individuals seeking to escape accountability for wrongdoings.

The DMK chief also accused the Opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) of a “betrayal of the state’s interests” through its alliance with the BJP.

Addressing the persistent issue of attacks on fishermen, Stalin condemned the Sri Lankan Navy’s aggression and said the Union government had displayed “neglect and disregard” by failing to take decisive action.

“We continuously condemn these attacks, but the Union government does not take any action to protect the fishermen,” he alleged.

The CM added that the DMK government had passed a resolution in the Assembly urging the Centre to intervene with Sri Lanka, which the Union government refused to do.

Stalin also criticised the Centre’s economic and education policies, including GST, NEET, and the National Education Policy (NEP), which he said had “deprived Tamil Nadu of its financial rights and hindered progress.”

He accused the Centre of neglecting Tamil Nadu’s educational needs and failing to support key research projects like Keezhadi.

The Chief Minister reaffirmed his party’s commitment to the Dravidian model of governance. “The Dravidian model of governance will prevail, and we’ll work tirelessly to make Tamil Nadu a leading state in the country,” he said.

Earlier, Stalin inaugurated development projects worth Rs 738 crore in Ramanathapuram district. The Chief Minister, while detailing the progress in the district, said that 46,270 projects valued at Rs 3,250 crore are currently underway in Ramanathapuram.

“This government has provided various benefits, including the Women’s Rights Allowance to 2.36 lakh women, assistance to over 8 lakh farmers, and nutritious breakfast to 83,483 children daily,” the Chief Minister said at the event.

The new projects launched on Friday included the opening of the Ramanathapuram railway station, the Thangachimadam Government Higher Secondary School building, and a social justice hostel for college students in Paramakudi.

Stalin also highlighted welfare measures for the fishing community, noting that about 1.85 lakh fishermen have benefited from various schemes, and his government has provided cooperative loans worth Rs 57 crore to 81,518 fishermen, exceeding the initial target of 45,000 beneficiaries.","Ramanathapuram (Tamil Nadu), Oct 3 (IANS) Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K.

365777428,Manisha Chauhan to lead India ‘A’ women’s hockey team in five-match tour of China,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) India A women’s hockey team is all set to embark on an important tour of China, where the team will play a five-match series at the Liaoning Sports Centre in Dalian from October 13 to 21.

Over eight days, India A will contest against Liaoning on October 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21. The squad for the tour has been selected to showcase a blend of some experienced players and promising young players, many of whom have earned recognition at the national level recently.

The team will be led by accomplished defender Manisha Chauhan, who brings leadership experience and tactical acumen to the squad. The squad will be coached by Dave Smolenaars, the analytical coach of the Indian women’s team, who will lend his vast experience with tactical innovation and player development to this tour.

Speaking about the opportunity, Dave Smolenaars said, “We have assembled a strong, young squad with great potential. The series in China provides an excellent platform for players to showcase their abilities, learn in a new environment, and build valuable international exposure. I’m confident that with their determination and teamwork, this group will make the most of this wonderful opportunity.

“It is crucial for the development of Indian women’s hockey that players are consistently challenged and given opportunities to compete outside their comfort zone. The lessons from this series in China will contribute a lot to their holistic growth and confidence in high-pressure situations.”

365777432,Pakistan’s power sector faces crisis as consumers shift to rooftop solar units,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) With more Pakistani households shifting to rooftop solar energy to escape the high cost of electricity from the official grid, the debt-ridden government of the country is facing a problem in paying its energy debts as there has been a decline in sales.

The government buys power from power plants and sells it to consumers, using revenues to pay back creditors such as China. But it’s long been doing so at a loss, and collections are now starting to decline as families and businesses increasingly generate their own clean power, according to a Bloomberg report.

The International Monetary Fund has also asked the Pakistan government to retain power customers to ensure the viability of the energy sector.

Lawmakers are now turning to unpopular reforms to stem that tide. Purchases of panels are now subject to import tariffs, the absence of which let their spread go unnoticed for months. The initial proposal involved an 18 per cent tax, which was about halved after public backlash, the report states.

Both panel and battery imports from China are on the rise. Pakistan imported $1.5 billion worth of panels this year, becoming the third-biggest importer globally, according to Bloomberg NEF. The analysts also estimate the country has 25 gigawatts of solar panels, installed without government support, a significant boost to its grid’s modest 50 gigawatts capacity.

The Government wants to increase utilisation of coal power plants or retire and repurpose them. The nation signed its largest-ever restructuring this month, including opening new loans with 18 banks worth a total 1.2 trillion rupees ($4.2 billion) in power sector debt, the report said.

Muhammad Ali, a member of the PM’s taskforce on the energy sector and the country’s privatisation minister said in an interview: “Unless we revise our solar policy, this defection from the grid will continue. That will further pressure Pakistan’s energy system that’s already dealing with a glut and the government must help create new demand.”

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which Islamabad had envisaged as an economic game-changer is actually turning out to be a costly venture as it has failed to achieve its targets and instead landed Pakistan in a $9.5 billion debt trap. The increase in the debt of the power sector has only added to this massive default on repayment of loans.

The initiative promised to give much-needed economic impetus to Pakistan but quickly entered uncharted waters and became mired in countless controversies. Thus, CPEC has very few outcomes to showcase. This delay has cost Pakistan dearly. The overdue energy and infrastructure projects, cost overruns, and accusations of opaque contracts have cost the initiative its viability.

Currently, Pakistan owes more than $7.5 billion for setting up power plants and additional nearly $2 billion to Chinese energy producers in circular debt, or unpaid bills.

Due to the delay in CPEC 2.0, Pakistan has been unable to establish the industrial base needed to transform into an export-driven economy and pay off its debts. Consequently, Pakistan had to seek more loans to pay past loans – resulting in a prolonged debt crisis.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) With more Pakistani households shifting to rooftop solar energy to escape the high cost of electricity from the official grid, the debt-ridden government of the&#8230; Continue reading Pakistan’s power sector faces crisis as consumers shift to rooftop solar units

365777440,"After F-16, J-17 fighter jets shot down, Pakistan begged for ceasefire: Air Force chief","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) India’s Operation Sindoor rained hell on Pakistani forces as its top fighter jets, including the US-made F-16s and Chinese-built J-17s, were destroyed during the four-day military showdown, said Air Chief Marshal A.P. Singh on Friday.

He said that the Indian military has proof of at least one long-range strike on an AEW&C aircraft and four to five strikes on fighter jets during Operation Sindoor.

Speaking at the 93rd Air Force Day celebrations in the capital, the IAF chief also trashed reports that Indian jets were downed in Pakistan’s reciprocal attacks and termed them as vicious propaganda by the Pakistani establishment to mislead its own citizens.

Shedding light on the suspense over the ceasefire in light of Operation Sindoor, he said that it was Pakistan, pummeled by Indian military strikes, which begged for a ceasefire.

“In Operation Sindoor, you saw the terrorists paying the price for killing innocent people. The world saw that we achieved our goal with precision strikes. We struck targets across 300 km, then they (Pakistan) asked for the ceasefire,” he said, while praising the country’s air defence systems for neutralising all Pakistani projectiles and drones during the intense military confrontation.

Notably, India’s precise airstrikes under Operation Sindoor saw the Indian Air Force destroying the terror infrastructure inside Pakistan as well as Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on May 7, as a strong reprisal for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. Indian forces destroyed nine terror camps and eliminated over 100 terrorists in the attack.

The IAF chief also informed that a clear directive and mandate were given to the Indian Armed Forces, and it achieved those objectives in a clear time frame without prolonging it.

“We took a call to terminate those hostilities because our own objectives were met. I think this is something that the world needs to learn from us,” he said.

He also said that there was a need to make the Armed Forces future-ready as the next war will be far different from the present face-off and informed that a renovation roadmap till 2047 was already under consideration.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) India’s Operation Sindoor rained hell on Pakistani forces as its top fighter jets, including the US-made F-16s and Chinese-built J-17s, were destroyed during the four-day&#8230; Continue reading After F-16, J-17 fighter jets shot down, Pakistan begged for ceasefire: Air Force chief

365777448,Road over Bridge near Hyderabad’s famous Falaknuma Palace thrown open,"Hyderabad, Oct 3 (IANS) A new Road over Bridge (RoB) was thrown open for traffic near historic Falaknuma Palace in the Old City of Hyderabad on Friday.

Hyderabad In-charge Minister Ponnam Prabhakar inaugurated the RoB, which has been built parallel to the existing RoB.

It is expected to ease traffic congestion on the key stretch, which connects Charminar-Falaknuma road to Chandrayangutta.

The 360-metre-long RoB, built for Rs 52.03 crore, is expected to benefit hundreds of commuters by reducing travel time and ensuring free-flowing traffic in one of the busiest areas in the Old City.

It will connect Chandrayangutta with major areas, significantly improving connectivity for thousands of tourists visiting Falaknuma Palace and Charminar.

It also comes as a relief for commuters travelling towards Falaknuma, Engine Bowli, Shamsheergunj, Aliabad, Chandrayangutta, and adjoining areas.

It took four years for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to complete the bridge over RoB over the Secunderabad-Falaknuma Broadgauge line.

The construction of RoB saw many hurdles, resulting in an inordinate delay. It was in 2018 that the Municipal Administration and Urban Development department cleared the proposal for the new parallel RoB.

An amount of Rs 52.03 crore was spent on GHMC civil work, railway scope work, shifting utilities of Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) and Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TGSPDCL), and land acquisition.

AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Rajya Sabha member Anil Kumar Yadav, MLAs Mohammed Mubeen and Mir Zulfiqar Ali, MLCs Riyazul Hasan Effendi and Mirza Rahmat Baig, Greater Hyderabad Mayor Gadwal Vijayalaxmi, GHMC Commissioner R. V. Karnan and others participated in the programme.

The RoB is one of the key projects taken up in and around the Old City in recent years to ease traffic congestion.

This has been inaugurated at a time when the preparatory work to provide Hyderabad Metro Rail connectivity to the Old City has gathered pace.

The state government has taken up work on the long-pending Metro Corridor from Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS) to Falaknuma.

Hyderabad Airport Metro Limited (HAML) said last month that the land acquisition and demolition of affected properties in the 7.5 km Old City Metro Corridor have reached a crucial stage.","Hyderabad, Oct 3 (IANS) A new Road over Bridge (RoB) was thrown open for traffic near historic Falaknuma Palace in the Old City of Hyderabad on Friday.

365777438,"Youth used as pawns, those who instigated violence will be identified: Ladakh L-G (IANS Interview) ","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) Ladakh Lieutenant Governor Kavinder Gupta on Friday said that the Union Territory is calm and normal after the sudden outburst of violence last month. He added that the administration is alert and on its toes to ensure that trouble mongers don’t exploit the opportunity to their advantage again.

In a special interaction with IANS, the Ladakh LG claimed that young people were used as pawns during the September 24 violence in the UT and the administration was in the process of identifying and isolating instigators for necessary action.

Below are the full excerpts of the interview:

IANS: How is the situation in Ladakh today? Who instigated the violence there?

Kavinder Gupta: The violence that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 was extremely unfortunate and tragic, resulting in the loss of four young lives. I express my deep sorrow.

Those young people were used as pawns. This should not have happened. We are committed to maintaining peace and calm in Ladakh. There are some people who do not want Ladakh to remain peaceful.

The situation has been brought under control. We are getting support from the common people as well. Overall, the current situation is peaceful. However, for maintaining peace and calm in the province and ensuring that such an outbreak doesn’t recur, it is essential to identify and isolate those who instigated the violence. However, the innocent ones will not be harmed at all.

IANS: What is your reaction to the Ladakh Apex Body’s refusal to negotiate with the Central Government?

Kavinder Gupta: In the past also, all problems in Ladakh have been resolved through talks. Dialogue remains the only way forward and only communication can resolve all problems.

IANS: Sonam Wangchuk’s wife has written a letter to the President and Prime Minister demanding his immediate release. What is your reaction to this?

Kavinder Gupta: I have also received his wife’s letter. However, any action by the Home Ministry must be based on credible evidence obtained under the National Security Act (NSA). There will be an investigation.

The good work done by Sonam Wangchuk should be commended. But, it is also a matter of investigation as to how the violence suddenly escalated in peaceful Ladakh, in a single day. If we hadn’t stopped violence within an hour-and-a-half, Leh would have been burnt. Who were the people behind it? This is a matter of investigation.

IANS: Will this violence affect Ladakh’s tourism?

Kavinder Gupta: I assure you that the situation will improve. The local people are also saying that the atmosphere deteriorated due to some individuals. This is a border state, so such incidents should not and will not happen again. The people of Leh-Ladakh have always stood shoulder to shoulder with the country during the 1965, 1971 and Kargil wars, and the Galwan Valley clash. The deaths of four people are a lesson for us. It is important to find out who instigated the violence. An investigation will be conducted.

IANS: Opposition parties are crying foul over the arrest of Sonam Wangchuk? What is your reaction?

Kavinder Gupta: Everyone knows who is trying to weaken the country. From Shaheen Bagh to “Gen Z,” the public has seen and recognised those who try to instigate public sentiments. There were attempts to provoke others by citing the example of Nepal, but the people rejected them. There were attempts to spoil the civilisational traditions of Ladakh, but we will not allow them to do so. Yes, a mistake was made, but such a mistake will not happen again.

IANS: How do you view the RSS completing 100 years?

Kavinder Gupta: Any organisation can last so long only if its foundation is strong. There is neither casteism nor religious fanaticism in the RSS.

The RSS has always stood in national interest. It has been functioning in the same way, as it was when it was founded by Dr. Hedgewar in 1925. I consider myself fortunate to be a volunteer of the RSS.

Whatever I have learnt, has been from the RSS. Those who see the Sangh only from a distance, question it, but those who have seen the Sangh up close have always respected it.","New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) Ladakh Lieutenant Governor Kavinder Gupta on Friday said that the Union Territory is calm and normal after the sudden outburst of violence last month.

365777446,"Gang kills physically challenged K’taka man, sets up accident scene to claim Rs 5.20 crore insurance","Vijayanagara (Karnataka), Oct 3 (IANS) Karnataka Police have busted a gang involved in the murder of a physically challenged man, who they tried to portray as an accident victim to claim a Rs 5.20 crore insurance policy taken out in his name.

The accused had made all preparations to claim the money and even applied through a fake wife, said officials.

The case was reported from Vijayanagara district and came to light following a complaint by his real wife, Sharadamma, and subsequent police investigation.

Six people, including a woman who claimed to be the deceased’s wife, have been arrested.

The accused were identified as Huligemma, who posed as the wife; Krishnappa from Koppal; Ravi and Ajay from Hospet; and Riyaz and Yograj Singh.

The deceased was identified as 34-year-old Gangadhar, a native of Jeeraganur village in Kampli taluk, who resided in Hospet.

Police have seized the car and moped used to commit the crime. The investigation was conducted by the Hospet Town Police Station.

Vijayanagara SP S. Jahnavi stated on Friday, “On September 28, we received a call at 5.30 a.m. regarding a hit-and-run case, with a body lying on Sandur Road. I, along with officers, visited the spot, and after due procedures, the body was shifted. Once the identity of the deceased was confirmed, his wife, Sharadamma, a resident of Kaulpet in Hospet town, was called to the police station, where she registered her complaint.”

SP Jahnavi further stated, “The couple had been married for six years. The deceased had suffered a stroke three years ago, losing control over the left side of his body. Gangadhar did not own a two-wheeler, which raised suspicion regarding the reported hit-and-run case, his wife stated.”

Police said a special team was formed to crack the case, and the accused were arrested within a day.

Police stated that the investigation revealed that the accused had taken an insurance policy in the name of the deceased worth Rs 5.20 crore, and the accused had conspired to claim the money by staging a hit-and-run incident. They created a fake wife and applied for the insurance under the name Ningamma. To claim the money, they hatched a murder plot. First, they killed him, then transported his body to the outskirts of Hospet town. They rented a second-hand bike, placed his body on it, and struck it with a car to make the incident appear as an accident and a hit-and-run before fleeing the scene.

The preliminary investigations revealed that the accused gang targeted homeless individuals, people with critical health conditions, and those who were physically weak, and deposited money in their savings bank accounts in their names.

Based on these deposits and bank accounts, they would take out life insurance policies, generally up to Rs 40 to Rs 50 lakh. They would designate nominees of their choice, and after the death of the insured person, they would give the nominee Rs 2 to 3 lakh while keeping the remaining amount for themselves.

The police have also stated that they are writing to the insurance company regarding the ongoing fraud.

The investigation is ongoing, and the accused gang is being probed for their involvement in similar cases.

More details are expected to emerge regarding the case.","Vijayanagara (Karnataka), Oct 3 (IANS) Karnataka Police have busted a gang involved in the murder of a physically challenged man, who they tried to portray as an accident victim to&#8230; Continue reading Gang kills physically challenged K&#8217;taka man, sets up accident scene to claim Rs 5.20 crore insurance

The team had a rocky start in their first game on October 2, succumbing to North Pilbara by 15 points, 3.4 (22) to 1.1 (7). Isobel Varney was the standout for the Kimberley women, kicking the team’s only goal.

The next round was a repeat of the previous with the Kimberley side falling short and handing the win to Esperance by 14 points, 3.3 (21) to 1.1 (7).

Varney again led the charge for the Kimberley team, again kicking the team’s only goal.

The Kimberley side claimed their first win of the championships in round five after a bye in round four, defeating the Goldfields in a close match by six points, 3.2 (20) to 2.2 (14), and earning themselves a ticket to the grand final against Esperance.

Simone Narkle led the scoring in the match kicking two goals and was backed by Shonterah Buck who kicked one.

The grand final clash went down to the wire, but Esperance scraped home by a point, 1.2 (8) to 1.1 (7).

Jorfran Hunter kicked the Kimberley side’s only goal in the match.

365785660,"Reece Walsh: The money-making, nail-painting hype machine who could win Brisbane a grand final","It was in Las Vegas in March 2024 that Brisbane played the Roosters in that inaugural season-opening double-header. The whole affair was mostly a curiosity for locals, but they did get to witness Walsh’s exquisite skill set when he set off and deftly kicked for Deine Mariner to score his team’s first try of 2024. This is the same guy who, a month earlier, was dubbed the “Tom Brady of Queensland” and then caught a pass from the NFL great himself.

The seven-time Super Bowl champion hurled the ball from the stage of a speaking engagement in Brisbane and watched as Walsh caught it on the run. The audience loved it. The internet did too. It was apparently one of the rare occasions he had been nervous. The event’s MC half-jokingly floated Walsh’s potential for an NFL career. “With your looks and skills, you’re looking at $25m to $30m a year,” he said. “And that’s US.”

The business of Walsh was booming, and nobody was happier than NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo and V’landys, the ARLC Commission chair, who’d used his 13-year-old daughter as his focus group to prove this “bloody good-looking” young man was single-handedly driving interest in the code among girls and young women.

“She’s got posters all over the wall of him, and she has no interest in rugby league whatsoever, even though I’m the chairman of the ARLC,” V’landys said on the eve of the 2023 grand final. “All she’s interested in is Reece Walsh ... he has a massive future as a rugby league player and as a rock star … he’s the full package. He has the looks, and there’s an element of charisma. There’s something that’s present that not many people have, but he’s got it.”

Walsh, of course, is not universally loved. Often characterised as the villain, he’s also criticised for being a player bigger than his club. Similar to the storm around Latrell Mitchell at South Sydney, his perceived power and reluctance to take part in media commitments helped feed a narrative that Walsh was given too long a leash and that had contributed to 2024’s failure. That, and the shirts-off training sessions that Walters’ successor Michael Maguire promptly prohibited in public. It was dubbed the “six-pack ban” and bolstered Maguire’s quest to drive higher standards, a successful endeavour as they stand 80 minutes away from a first premiership in 19 years.

For Walsh, Maguire’s tight ship offers a more streamlined vessel towards the complete player being slowly developed since he was an Indigenous Australian-Maori kid growing up in Nerang on the Gold Coast. In another life, Walsh might have been a chippie like his father.",The one-man hype match is 23 years old but has already lived enough for someone of a far greater vintage.,https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/sport/nrl/reece-walsh-the-money-making-nail-painting-hype-machine-who-could-win-brisbane-a-grand-final-20251002-p5mzhp.html,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5516%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/2ea1a61e19365c40d65033914173daf018cf8c5e6f3e697d68bd47a3a4b7a1d4,,2025-10-03 08:30:00,"Dan Walsh,Emma Kemp","['Dan Walsh', 'Emma Kemp']",en,au,0.2,

Australia’s relations with the mother country are going altogether splendidly, to the joy of some and anger of others. After a convivial meeting with King Charles at Balmoral last weekend, PM Anthony Albanese veered off course to the Labour Party conference in Liverpool – where he was equally well received.

Opposition Leader Sussan Ley was not amused by his Liverpool detour. “He shouldn’t be swanning around on the taxpayer dollar hanging out with his left-wing mates,” she told Australians.

Reader Riley Brown didn’t feel the joy either. “His trip to the Labour conference is a misuse of taxpayer funds,” he wrote, even suggesting the National Anti-Corruption Commission look into it.

Not everyone felt that strongly. Barrington Salter, worried about the rising popularity of Nigel Farage’s UK Unite party, was “quite happy to chip in a few bucks to help suppress the move to far-right extremism.”

Predictably, the PM’s visit dusted off the old question of cutting ties with Britain. Albanese quickly nipped that in the bud. “I wanted to hold one referendum while I was prime minister, and we did that,” he said, referring to the Indigenous Voice.

But angry republican Bruce McKinnon demanded he cut the apron strings. “Don’t get cocky in assuming that you know what we all want,” he wrote.

A resigned Vivien Clark- Ferraino saw little chance of dumping the monarchy. “The last referendum demonstrated what many Australians are: timid, clinging to colonial symbols and allergic to change.”

The Herald’s editorial questioning a $200,000 annual pension package for disgraced NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian raised the ire of many readers.

“How is acceptable that the public should support a person who has acted in a corrupt manner?” asked Bob Nichol.

Aidan Cuddington was also sceptical, writing: “Sadly, those with their snouts in the trough will make no effort to fix the situation, and they are the only ones who can change things.”

“Sign it all over to Kathleen Folbigg,” suggested David Earp.

The Herald restated its core principles this week in a wrap-around titled “Here’s to reason”, reassuring readers of its commitment to responsible journalism.

Reader Bradley Wynne bemoaned the “blizzard” of news and information choices, writing: “Amid all this useless and unhelpful chatter, the call to reason is most welcome.”

“Congratulations on a very sobering take on the world we live in,” added Donna Wiemann.

Edward Loong took a philosophical view. “Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form,” he observed.

365776918,"Reece Walsh: The money-making, nail-painting hype machine who could win Brisbane a grand final","It was in Las Vegas in March 2024 that Brisbane played the Roosters in that inaugural season-opening double-header. The whole affair was mostly a curiosity for locals, but they did get to witness Walsh’s exquisite skill set when he set off and deftly kicked for Deine Mariner to score his team’s first try of 2024. This is the same guy who, a month earlier, was dubbed the “Tom Brady of Queensland” and then caught a pass from the NFL great himself.

The seven-time Super Bowl champion hurled the ball from the stage of a speaking engagement in Brisbane and watched as Walsh caught it on the run. The audience loved it. The internet did too. It was apparently one of the rare occasions he had been nervous. The event’s MC half-jokingly floated Walsh’s potential for an NFL career. “With your looks and skills, you’re looking at $25m to $30m a year,” he said. “And that’s US.”

The business of Walsh was booming, and nobody was happier than NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo and V’landys, the ARLC Commission chair, who’d used his 13-year-old daughter as his focus group to prove this “bloody good-looking” young man was single-handedly driving interest in the code among girls and young women.

“She’s got posters all over the wall of him, and she has no interest in rugby league whatsoever, even though I’m the chairman of the ARLC,” V’landys said on the eve of the 2023 grand final. “All she’s interested in is Reece Walsh ... he has a massive future as a rugby league player and as a rock star … he’s the full package. He has the looks, and there’s an element of charisma. There’s something that’s present that not many people have, but he’s got it.”

Walsh, of course, is not universally loved. Often characterised as the villain, he’s also criticised for being a player bigger than his club. Similar to the storm around Latrell Mitchell at South Sydney, his perceived power and reluctance to take part in media commitments helped feed a narrative that Walsh was given too long a leash and that had contributed to 2024’s failure. That, and the shirts-off training sessions that Walters’ successor Michael Maguire promptly prohibited in public. It was dubbed the “six-pack ban” and bolstered Maguire’s quest to drive higher standards, a successful endeavour as they stand 80 minutes away from a first premiership in 19 years.

For Walsh, Maguire’s tight ship offers a more streamlined vessel towards the complete player being slowly developed since he was an Indigenous Australian-Maori kid growing up in Nerang on the Gold Coast. In another life, Walsh might have been a chippie like his father.",The one-man hype match is 23 years old but has already lived enough for someone of a far greater vintage.,https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/reece-walsh-the-money-making-nail-painting-hype-machine-who-could-win-brisbane-a-grand-final-20251002-p5mzhp.html,https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5516%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_58/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/2ea1a61e19365c40d65033914173daf018cf8c5e6f3e697d68bd47a3a4b7a1d4,,2025-10-03 08:30:00,"Dan Walsh,Emma Kemp","['Dan Walsh', 'Emma Kemp']",en,au,0.2,
365793516,Massive fire erupts at oil refinery near Los Angeles,"A fire has broken out at a Chevron oil refinery just outside Los Angeles, sending towering flames into the night air that were visible for kilometres.

Officials in El Segundo, California, urged people to stay indoors on Thursday night, although they said there was no immediate threat to public safety and no evacuations had been ordered.

There were no injuries at the Chevron El Segundo Refinery and all personnel were accounted for, the company said in a statement, adding that a monitoring system indicated the fire did not move beyond the facility's fence line.

The statement did not say what caused the fire.

LA County Supervisor Holly Mitchell told KCAL-TV that fire crews had contained the blaze to one section of the refinery.

California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said it was monitoring the situation and co-ordinating with state and local authorities to protect the surrounding community.

El Segundo is a beachside city about 2km south of Los Angeles International Airport.

LA Mayor Karen Bass wrote in a post on X that there was no known impact to the airport.

The refinery covers roughly four square kilometres and has more than 1770km of pipelines, according to the company's website.

The refinery, which has been in operation since 1911, is one of the largest on the US west coast and can refine up to 290,000 barrels of crude oil a day, including petrol, jet and diesel fuels.",Flames have soared into the night sky after a blaze erupted at one of the largest oil refineries on the US west coast.,https://thewest.com.au/news/disaster-and-emergency/massive-fire-erupts-at-oil-refinery-near-los-angeles-c-20227984,https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20227984/5fc31f24eb458eb823084e55861256e23dacf1a8-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200,,2025-10-03 08:29:57,Ethan Swope,['Ethan Swope'],en,au,-0.386,
